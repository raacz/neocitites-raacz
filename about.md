My favourite colour is blue. Could you tell? 

## These days...

I do a lot of Toki Pona stuff. I teach Toki Pona privately on italki. I teach a weekly Luka Pona class on the *kama sona* Discord. I do some volunteer tutoring as well. I start and stop lots of projects without finishing them. 

I do lots of stuff related to website accessibility. If you want me to audit your website for WCAG failures, do reach out. 

I have a very small day job that helps me get out of bed everyday. I help children cross the street safely.
