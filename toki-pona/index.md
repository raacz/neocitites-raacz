is a language that has less than 200 words and was made by a French Canadian woman in 2001. I first started learning in 2019. I have since done a lot of things with it and I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable about the language and the microcommunities that surround it.

[Beginner Texts](beginner-material/) I've recently created some pieces intended for people who are just starting to read Toki Pona. 

Other:
- [mooooooooooooooo.](mooooooooooooooo/), six random English language poetic outbursts about Toki Pona. 
- [(Outdated) My Toki Pona Work](pali/). an (outdated) index of some work I've done within the community
