Control how different versions are presented together. 
- <strong>Regular.</strong> Texts are presented without any special formatting.
- <strong>Quiz.</strong> Lose the ability to see the contextualizing picture and lose the ability to toggle English. 
- <strong>Line by Line.</strong> Here you can choose to reveal the English translation for just a single sentence you are focused on, without revealing the English for the entire text. Alternatively, reveal one sentence in Sitelen Lasina (the Latin alphabet) when reading using Sitelen Pona (Toki Pona hieroglyphs). 
- <strong>Table. </strong>Directly compare lines across two or all three versions in a table.
