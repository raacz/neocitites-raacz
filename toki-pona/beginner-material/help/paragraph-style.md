Choose between two different styles of Sitelen Pona (Toki Pona hieroglphs).
- **Indented** makes use of line breaks and indentation to clarify the structure of Toki Pona sentences. For example, verbs pertaining to a single subject might be visually grouped together, or different sentences that fall under a single context statement might be visually grouped together. In this style, sentence-ending punctuation is not used. Instead, the ends of sentences are inferred by the grammar and the way that the sentences are indented. 
- **Flat** collapses all line breaks and removes all indentations, and uses punctuation to indicate the end of sentences. You have a choice between what should be used as punctuation. The **Interpunct** looks like a vertically-centered period, ``·``. The **CJK Final** is a small unfilled circle ``。︁``, named as such because of its use in Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
