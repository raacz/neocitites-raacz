Control how Sitelen Pona (Toki Pona hieroglyphs) text is encoded. 
- **Use ASCII.** This is the default. In ASCII-based Sitelen Pona, the font turns text like "mi moku" into Sitelen Pona. Certain browsers have issues with displaying ASCII-based Sitelen Pona. 
- **Use UCSUR.** In [UCSUR](/toki-pona/beginner-material/ucsur.md)-based Sitelen Pona, text is written using special characters. For example, "mi moku" is 󱤴​󱤶. Browsers have less issues with displaying UCSUR-based Sitelen Pona. However, sometimes my converter that changes the text from ASCII to UCSUR messes up and doesn't display certain modified 'variant glyphs' properly. 
- **Use UCSUR on Current Page** vs **Use UCSUR Always.** UCSUR preferences are not saved like other settings. Selecting the UCSUR setting to be "on Current Page" will not affect the next page or story that your visit. Selecting "Use UCSUR Always" will save your preference to localStorage, meaning the device will remember to use UCSUR for all your subsequent visits.
