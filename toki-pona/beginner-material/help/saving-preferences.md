The website will remember your preferences as you move from page to page while you're in the same tab. 

Depending on the browser you use, your preferences might duplicate over if you open a tab in the same window. But if you have two different tabs of Beginner Stories open, changing your reader preferences in one tab will not affect the other. 

Closing the window will reset your preferences to the default settings. 

Note that UCSUR preferences are saved slightly differently.
