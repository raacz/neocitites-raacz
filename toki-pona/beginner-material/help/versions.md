- **<a href="https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_pona">Sitelen Pona</a>** is the name of Toki Pona's hieroglyphic writing system.
- **<a href="https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_Lasina">Sitelen Lasina</a>** is the Toki Pona name for the Latin script. The Latin alphabet has been adopted and expanded upon to suit many languages. For example, English, Croatian, Tagalog, Turkish, Swahili, and Vietnamese all can be written using slight variations of the Latin script. The words you're currently reading use the Latin script. 
- **English** translations may be ungrammatical and uncanny at times. This is intentional in most cases. For more information, see ["About my English Translations" (in-page link)](/toki-pona/beginner-material/index.html#about-english-translations).
