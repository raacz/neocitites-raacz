## Notes


### About my English Translations

The English translations can be very helpful. But when you use them, it's good to be aware of the following things: 

<details markdown="1">
  
  <summary> <h4>Literal Translations</h4></summary>
  
  You may notice that some of the English translations appear to be ungrammatical, strange, or uncanny. This is because I've tried hard to reflect Toki Pona syntax and semantics in the English itself.
  
  For example, I might translate something like, "I arrive in the large building's basement," **<span lang="tok">mi kama lon anpa pi tomo suli</span>**, as "I come to be located at the large building's underside."
  
  - **<span lang="tok">kama</span>**, used in this phrase as a preverb, is literally "come to be"
  - **<span lang="tok">lon</span>**, used in this phrase as a preposition, is literally "located at"
  - **<span lang="tok">anpa pi tomo suli</span>** is literally  "the large building's underside"
  
  I hope this style of translation, while being slightly ungraceful, helps emphasize the language's unique structure and tendencies to learners.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary><h4>Multiple 'Right' Answers</h4></summary>
  
  My English translations offer *one* correct interpretation of the material, but *other correct interpretations are possible*.
  
  For example, a **<span lang="tok">tomo suli</span>** can be a large structure, an important home, and old mansion, a large bus.
  
  When I translate a Toki Pona word, I am often forced to pick just one, specific, English word, even though the Toki Pona word is more broad. If you happen to think of a different word than the one I pick, it doesn't necessarily mean that you were wrong.
  
  For example, if your translation is **'big house'** and my translation is  **'old structure,'** and the picture is of a large, old mansion, **we are both right.**
  
  Consulting a [good dictionary](https://nimi.li) is one way to confirm your own interpretation, especially if you are just getting used to the words.

tldr; try not to treat the English Translations too authoritatively. 

### About my Toki Pona

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>
    <h4>Non-Standard Words</h4>
  </summary>
  
  In the stories, I use the same words that I seriously use in real life.
  
  In <span lang="tok"><a href="https://linku.la/about?q=">lipu Linku</a></span> terms, relying on 2025 polling data, this means all **Core** words as well as the **Common** words: <span lang="tok">kipisi, kin, leko, meli, mije, misikeke, monsuta, n, namako, soko, tonsi</span>; and the **Uncommon** word: <span lang="tok">majuna</span>.

  You are free to use and not use whatever words you like. Most teachers recommend taking the time to really understand the **Core** words before experimenting with other words. See: "Can I add a new word?" at [/r/tokipona's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/wiki/faq/).

    <h4>Using Sitelen Pona</h4>
  </summary>

  All texts have both [Sitelen Pona](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_pona) and [sitelen Lasina](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_Lasina) versions. Each Sitelen Pona document is formatted separately; it is not simply a matter of applying a different font. There may be differences between the two versions. 

  

  I use a punctuation-less indented style of Sitelen Pona, and the site uses the <span lang="tok"><a href="https://github.com/etbcor/nasin-nanpa">nasin nanpa</a></span> font throughout.

  I regularly make use of the directional <span lang="tok">ni</span> to indicate <span lang="tok">e ni: </span>clauses.

    <h4>Grammatical Choices</h4>
  </summary>

  In this texts, I've decided to use some of these grammatical styles:

  Extensions:
  - extended <span lang="tok">li</span> style with <span lang="tok">mi</span> and <span lang="tok">sina</span>. 
  - multiple <span lang="tok">pi</span> phrases can be used subsequently (used only in Quest texts)
  - <span lang="tok">lukin</span> is used as a preverb meaning 'to try to' instead of <span lang="tok">alasa</span>

Restrictions:
  - <span lang="tok">kepeken</span> cannot be used as a content word
  - prepositional phrases cannot modify the subject
  - prepositional phrases cannot be used as transitive predicates
  - <span lang="tok">open</span> and <span lang="tok">pini</span> cannot be used as preverbs

The vast majority of these stories feature images that are licensed under versions of CC-BY or CC-BY-SA.

In brief, 

- CC-BY: Use in any way you want (even use it to make money) but attribute the author and link to the original license. 
- CC-BY-SA: Use in any way you want, attributing the author and linking to the original license, but anything you make with it also has to be licensed as CC-BY-SA.

CC-BY-SA is also the license that Beginner Stories uses for the vast majority of its content.

For more information on my personal motivation behind using Creative Commons licenses, read [jLakuse o, Why Creative Commons](/toki-pona/beginner-material/cc/).

But there are **two major exceptions.** 

- In the case that a page features an image that is licensed under GFDL-1.2, the page comprises a document licensed under GFDL-1.2. Details for the GFDL license will be clearly indicated above the footer. 


<li tabindex="-1" id="licensing-quirk">In the case that a page features an image that is licensed under CC-BY-NC, the text of that page is still licensed under CC-BY-SA, as <a href="https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/cccertificate/chapter/collections-and-remixes">Creative Commons licenses do not recognize</a> a grouping together of discrete works into one work as an 'Adaptation'. Pages that feature a CC-BY-NC image have a note above the footer that links to this explanation.<br>
Do be aware that the CC-BY-NC image's license remains in effect, meaning that while you <em>can</em> sell a properly reproduced version of <strong>just the CC-BY-SA text</strong>, you <em>cannot</em> reproduce <strong>the CC-BY-NC image/CC-BY-SA text combination</strong> for commercial purposes.</li>
