kala asi feedback:
- quiz bar displacement solution?
- padding to image caption
- marking as read footer set as flex 1 to children
- fix high contrast
- image attribution perhaps under the image
- understand the weird english+sp+sl behaviour on certain viewports
- ability to trigger indenteless sp mode
- sequence previews need to be fully clickable


responsive:
- ensure mobile styling work
content:
- finish the sp article
- make three quest stories
- need a tutorial page

NAME: should 'theme' texts actually be 'topic' texts? probably. i should change it. 


accessibility:
- ensure proper language tagging throughout
- consider making invisible headings
- enable character key shortcuts..?
- styled focus links
- it appears that tabbing to form controls are broken when fieldsets are nested. firefox vanilla is fine, orca skips em but can access with form control toggle, chromium vanilla skips em.

technical:
- ensure that tok [!] can be replaced with sp [a] in sorting algo
- rate each theme by a percentage difficulty, sort and iterate by that percentage. 

reading list todo:
- word-based achievements

general ui improvements
- all pages get a word count use word count to determine if the thing needs to not reflow as rows, so we never end up in a gross look situation
- sp, alone on regular, should never reflow probably...



ideas for quest texts:
-alcohol page nonwithstanding
-dragon quest nonwithstanding
-mormon approach to coffee
- cybertruck

ideas for theme pages
- circus
- Bekonscot Model Village
- what's at the parade?
- waso and kala but humans (mermaid performance)
- robocup eindhoven 
- series of photos from planes looking down at weird things
- bartools like https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bartool1.jpg

weird flashcard / multiple-choice thing maybe?
