responsive:
- ensure mobile styling works.

content:
- finish the sp article
- make three quest stories
- need a tutorial page


accessibility:
- ensure proper language tagging throughout
- consider making invisible headings
- enable character key shortcuts
- dark mode
- styled focus links

technical:
- ensure that tok [!] can be replaced with sp [a] in sorting algo
- rate each theme by a percentage difficulty, sort and iterate by that percentage. 

reading list todo:
- word-based achievements

general ui improvements
- all pages get a word count use word count to determine if the thing needs to not reflow as rows, so we never end up in a gross look situation
- sp, alone on regular, should never reflow probably...


ideas for theme pages
- circus
- Bekonscot Model Village
- what's at the parade?
- waso and kala but humans (mermaid performance)
- robocup eindhoven 
- series of photos from planes looking down at weird things
- bartools like https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bartool1.jpg

weird flashcard / multiple-choice thing maybe?
