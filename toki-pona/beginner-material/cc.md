Things aren't as permanent as we'd like them to be. 

Many people don't get to live as long as they want to.

As individual artists and collective members of the  community, our ability to preserve our own history has been at times, very fragmented. 

Our community's boat has been built and rebuilt several times and when we're all gone it will have been rebuilt again. 

My heart breaks for generations of Esperanto texts that went out of print, that slowly became unavailable at each Congress Book Service, whose pages were never scanned, that slowly became lost media.

Even if the whole community adopts practices of sharing and attributing work, that won't fix the problem. Additionally, there's a significant difference between something **not being lost media** and **something being remembered**. 

But, hopefully, in the end, less things will fall through the cracks than would have fallen otherwise.
