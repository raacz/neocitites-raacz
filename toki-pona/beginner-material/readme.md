# Hello there

This place is a bit of a mess. 

Currently I am doing the story-writing myself but I often make typos and errors; feel free to send in corrections if you see any of those.

# Lakuse's Checklist

## kala Asi outstanding 
- potentially move image attr under the image
    > currently quiz mode creates weird diplacement (also note lbl does this too)

## Technical 
- adjust breakpoints on homepage to ensure the mobile screenshots are shown and collage moves to flex earlier
- change the figure / figcaption styling to be genre specific
- hover and focus styles

### stories
- quest stories mvp
    > finish the dragon story (probably two more to go)
    > finish the hiroshige story (one more to go)

ideas for theme pages

- waso and kala but humans (mermaid performance)
- robocup eindhoven 
- series of photos from planes looking down at weird things
- bartools like https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bartool1.jpg
