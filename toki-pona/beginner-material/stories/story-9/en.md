The land is very hot. I feel hot. I want the cold.

Many people feel like me. We search for the cold. 

Ah, liquid is here. Is it cold?

I feel the liquid using my hand. The liquid is cold. 

I remove my foot's clothing. At this time, my foot is not covered. 

I offer my foot to the liquid. A pleasant feeling, ah! A good feeling, ah! 

Many people watch my work and my happiness. 

They too remove clothing and offer their feet to the liquid. 

Under the hot sun, we all feel good because of foot-washing coldness.
