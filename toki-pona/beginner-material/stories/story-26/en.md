A parental bird parents many small birds. 

Many small birds is big work. 

All the small birds need food. 

The parental bird doesn't want to continue to parent all the birds. 

The parental bird looks at one of its small birds. 

Should I kill you?

Hm... no. You are strong. 

I should kill a different small bird.
