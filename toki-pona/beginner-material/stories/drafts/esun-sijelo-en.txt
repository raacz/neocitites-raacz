## Bodily trading

### Badness and trading of a black leg

#### Method of bodily trading

Using this method, people of body knowledge are able to improve many bodily negatives: the person of a bad body tool comes to have a new tool from a person of a good body tool.

Possibly, a person is broken like this: Their heart comes to be unable to work well. The heart can't move the red liquid using a good amount of power. Possibly, strange bumps or strange holes are on the heart. 

When a person of a good heart is dead, a knowledgeable person is able to remove the bad heart from the body of the broken person and is able to tradingly give the good heart of the dead person. 

With this method, a broken person can come to not be broken. This is the method of bodily trading. 

The method of bodily trading is good or what?

Not all good. Truly, this method is only a tool. Using this tool, people can do work of a good way and can do work of a bad way. 

Internally picture this:

My heart can't adequately move liquid, so I am coming to be dead. But I look at you. You are not coming to be dead. Your heart is not broken. Therefore I kill you. A knowledgeable person gives your heart to me so I don't die. 

Bad, or what? Bad ah! All are able to know this: When bodily trading needs to kill a non-dead person, this is bad. 

A tool is located at people's bodies are removes grossness from the red liquid and makes gross yellow liquid. Internally picture this: The making tool of yellow liquid is broken in my body so I am coming to be dead. But I look at you. You have two good yellow-liquid tools. Therefore I make a strange no-movement liquid and give it to your food using a covered method. You of no knowledge, consume it and come to be unable to move and come to be unable to communicate. A knowledgeable person cuts one good tool from your body and gives it to my body. I am not dead! Additionally, you are not dead. 

No person died. But continually, this is also bad! In the context of bodily trading, use only these tools: people want to give them. 

What other bad methods are possible? Come to be listening to the telling of black leg. 

#### The telling of black leg

The telling of a black leg is from one divine-path group. The group feels this: A human god of complete goodness badly died on a stick. This death made a path of complete and good becoming for all the lowly people of this human god.

In a distant finished time, Cosmas and Damian came from the same parent at the same time. They both worked a lot in the divine-path grouped. In the context of work, they improved the bodies of other people using knowledge and using divine power. They did a lot of not possible things. Their divine path and their work was bad from the perspective of the ruling group. The ruling people contained them and really harmed their bodies and said this: "When you two dismiss the bad divine path, you are able to not die!" But Cosmas and Damian and three other people of the same parental group did not dismiss the divine path and died badly. The ruling people transfered their bodies to sticks, birdily emitted many hard things and many small cutting sticks. At the closing, a ruling person cut all their heads. Bad death ah. 

This divine path group feels this: When good ah people of lots of powerful divine work die, the Parental Divine come to be listening to the communication of these good dead people at many times. In many divine-path groups, lowly people communicate their desires to the Divine. But in this divine path group, lowly people can communicate their desires to good dead people too. The group feels this: Good dead people are able to newly communicate a lowly person's communication to the Parental Divine. This enlargens this possibility: The Divine creates the the lowly person's desire. 

The telling of the black leg is like this:

In Rome-land, one working person of the divine building felt very bad. A bad bodily grossness was destroying one of their legs and was coming to be larger and was coming to be larger.  

When the working person slept, they came to see something powerful. 

Cosmas and Damian came to be located at nearby and had tools of body improvement. 

One of them communicated. "We should remove all the gross skin using a cut. We should give new skin to the hole. The new skin can be from which thing?"

The other communicated. "At a nearby place, one person of Ethiopia-land died at this sun time. Their body is located at a divine building's death place. We can use it."

Therefore they both came to have the leg of the Black person and cut the leg of the working person and traded the good leg and the black leg. 

The working person finished the sleep and felt no bad feelings. They touched the leg and felt no injury. They looked at the leg and looked at no injury. Am I me? The working person felt strangely. But when the strange feeling left, a powerful good feeling came to be existing. They leg-moved powerfully from the resting surface and communicated the injury and sleep image and goodness to all. The group listened to the communication and hunted for the Black person's dead place. The group saw this: on the Black person's body, one black leg was gone. One white leg was present. 

#### The representation of the black leg

In the telling of the black leg, the method of bodily trading is strange and is not like the existing method. 

Strangely, the bodily exchange is a two-transfer exchange. A black leg comes to be located on a white body. A white leg comes to be located on a black leg. 

True body exchanges are exchanges of only one transfer. 

This is not largely strange because of this: This is a not-existing communication. But still, this not-existing gives existing knowledge of bad group methods. 

The telling of the black leg wants this: When you listen to it, you feel good. You see this: a becoming-dead person doesn't come to be dead. This is good! All is well. 


Not all is well. 


#### The desire of the giving person

In the existing time, the desire of the giving person is important. When the giving person's tool comes to leave from the giving person's body and comes to be located at the body of a different person, that happened bacuse of this: the giving person wanted to give. When a giving person is dead, still, their desire is important. When people do not communicate their gving desire at a not-dead time, they cannot come to be giving people at the dead-time ah. This is a good method and is also a law method. 

At the existing time, not-dead people are able to communicate their giving desire of the dead time. All knowledge people must listen to the desire. 

But ah. In the telling of the black leg, the desire of the Black person is what? Do they want to give their leg?

Possibly, you feel this: The hunt for this knowledge is not important. The Black person is dead and cannot communicate. 

Truley, when this Black person was not dead, they didn't know this: In the arriving time, a person was able to need their leg. 

But Cosmas and Damian are also dead! When the Black person is dead, this does not remove their communication ability. They both are able ah to communicate this to the Black person: "Should we use your leg?" But Cosmas and Damian don't do this. 

In the telling of the black leg, the Black person's death is not bad. Truly, the Black person's death is good because of this: When the Black person is dead, the white person is able to be not dead. 

Know this ah: Cosmas and Damian are very powerful. In other tellings, both of them can happen this: Dead people come to be not dead. But in this telling, the Black person is dead at the start and continues to be dead at the end. 

Possibly, Cosmas and Damian give goodness to people only of the divine path, or what? Know this: The Black person is a person of the divine path! Because of this, their body is located at the death place of the divine building. 

In the telling of the black leg, this is the way: When a white person is coming to be dead, this is destruction! The Divine should good them! When a Black person is dead, this is not destruction. At this time, their dead body is able to be a tool for the goodness of the white person. 

#### Bad giving


Cosmas and Damian use the Black person and do not give goodness to them. Additionally, Cosmas and Damian give badness to the Black person. 

A good black leg goes to the white person. 
A gross white leg goes to the Black person. 

This gross leg is a bodily destructive grossness of this method: It comes to be bigger and comes to be bigger and consumes all. 

The actions of these two divine knowledgeable people are bad ah. Not only the leg removal destroys the Black person's body. Largely possible, in the arriving time, all of their body will come to be destroyed from the powerful leg grossness. 

#### Knowledge of the black leg

Goodness of white people needs this: ruling people dismiss the Black people's communication ability and use Black people's bodies and damage Black people's bodies. 

The telling of the black leg is a not-existing communication and is a communication of the distant finished time. But possibly, the making person of this telling is this power: They adequately know the bad methods of the arriving time.
