### Symbol name and symbol method

Hiroshige made many image groups of the Big Road Tōkaidō. 

Look at the depictions. These four depictions are from different depiction groups and are from different years. 

But all of them are very similar to the eye. 

All of them depict Odawara land and the path-liquid Sakawa. With all of them, workers move people to the liquid's other side. With all of them, plants are present. With all of them, the land is flat at the front and very bumpy at the back. 

Also, Hiroshige gave very similar names to all of them. 

This is not very good from the perspective of these people: they hunt for knowledge of amusing depictions. 

"Ah, the image of Odawara land is very good to me!"

Communicate this: which picture group of Odawara-land do is ver good to you?

"The first one!"

Ah, in the context of this, I understand. 

"Also, the fourth one!"

Hm...

Truly, people know the numbering of the first image group only. Hiroshige's second work is what? No knowledge. The third one and the seventh one are what? No knowledge. 

Therefore a numbering method is able to adequately name only the first depiction group. All of the other ones need a name of a different method. 

#### The Gyosho group and the Reisho group

Naming methods are not only one and are many. Come to be looking at the first depiction and the second depiction. 

The first depiction is from the Gyosho group. Hiroshige depicted the same land from a different side, from a little distance. The big ruling building is not at this. All the people are visually very small. 

The second depiction is from the Reisho group. Hiroshige depicts the same land. But all the people are not at a big distance. They are located near ah. I can see people's eyes and people's mouths and people's head string. 

But the word 'Gyosho' and the word 'Reisho' are because of what?

#### Many depicting methods of the Japan language

With the Japan language, the word Gyosho and the word Reisho are words of two depicting systems. 

Depictions of the Japan language are from depictions of the China language. The old method is different to the existing method. 

At the finished time, word depictions were very circly and wanted to be visually very good ah. Many words wanted to depict things of their communication. Samely, in Toki Pona's Sitelen Pona, the word 'foot' depicts a foot. 

But truly, depictions must not only be good visually. Many people came to be using depictive communication at many times. Many people wanted two documents of the same communication and made new documents from parental documents. When many people wanted to depict many words using a little time, the depiction method came to be different. 

The Reisho depiction method was one powerful method of the finished time. With this method, all depictions were vertical-sufacey small and horizontal-surfacey big. Many lines were openly small and finishingly big. 

But when time arrived and left, many people came to be not using the Reisho depiction system and came to be using a new method. With the new good method of the existing time, many depictions are big like a block of four same sides. Additionally, the line bigness was very same bigness at the start and at the end. 

When a tool depicts a word using a new method, it draws the first line and leaves and draws the second line and leaves and draws the third line...

But people are not tools. At not all times, they remove the hand. At times, they depict two lines at the same time and do not remove the hand. In the context of this action, the line becomes slighly visually circular. Truly, this is the Gyosho depiction method. 

With the Sosho depiction method,depictions are very powerfully entertaining. At times, a person is not able to know this: the Sosho depiction method depicts which word. 

The Gyosho depiction method and the good depiction method of the present time are not all the same. But they are slightly similar. 
The Gyosho depiction method and the Sosho depiction method are not all the same. But they are slightly similar. 

The Gyosho depiction method is a depiction method of slight amusement. 
The Reisho depiction method is a powerful depiction method of the finished time. 

In the context of Hiroshige, at the front of the Gyosho depiction group, the working person depicted using the Gyosho depiction method. At the front of the Reisho depiction group, the working person depicted using the Reisho depiction method. 

From the depiction method, the knowledge people made names for these two depiction groups. 

#### The Aritaya group and the Kichizo group

Look again at the four depictions of Odawara land. 

The third depiction is from the Aritaya group. All of the depictions in the Aritaya group are small. With the Gyosho group and the Reisho group and the Aritaya group, all the plant sheets are the same bigness. But with the Gyosho group, one sheet has one depiction. With the Aritaya group, one sheet has four depictions. 

The fourth depiction is from the Kichizo group. With all the other depictions, the Sakawa pathy liquid is visually large. But in this depiction, the water is visually small. 

The word 'Kichizo' and the word 'Aritaya' are because of what?

They are shops. The Kichizo shop and the Aritaya shop transactioned Hiroshige's depictions.
