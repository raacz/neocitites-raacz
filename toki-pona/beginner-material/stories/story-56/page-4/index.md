alt: Collage of four very similar-looking wood block prints depicting river porters crossing travellers at a river, with mountains in the background. They are labelled as Gyosho, Reisho, Aritaya, and Kichizo, and vary in the level of detail, the angle from which we see them cross, and how wide the river is depicted to be.
