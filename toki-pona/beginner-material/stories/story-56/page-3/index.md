alt: This wood block print depicts a vast landscape. Mountains in the background tower over an otherwise flat plain. A small castle with battlements is nestled into its crevices. Nude river porters transport travellers across a river in the foreground-- sometimes carrying them on their shoulders, sometimes hoisted on wooden stakes, sometimes in a closed palanquin.
