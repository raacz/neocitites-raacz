### First depiction of Odawara land

Look at the depiction. 

Hiroshige depicted all of the resting lands of the Big Road Tōkaidō not at only one time. But this depiction is from his  first-time depiction group. 

This depiction depicts small-land Odawara and pathy water Sakawa. 

#### Odawara land is what

When people moved on the Big Road Tōkaidō, Odawara is the tenth resting land. 

At Odawara, a big hill exists. Also, a large building of a lesser ruling person exists. Can you see the building in this depiction ah? It is at this side of the big hill: many plants exist. An outer layer of large hard vertical surfaces protects this building of the ruling person. Many buildings of this large building are big from the top to the bottom and can adequately see land of much distance. Possibly, when a bad person arrives and wants to harm a person of the building's insides, a fighting person is able to be located at this elevated biulding and can send death tools to the bad person of the lower land. 

The large hill and large building are at the depiction's behind at a distance. The Sakawa pathy water is near and at the depiction's front. At the inside of the large hill and of the Sakawa water, the land has many small plants and is flat ah.

#### Water is fightingly good

The Sakawa water is fighting-methodly good. When bad people want to come to be fighting the ruling building of Odawara land, firstly, they must go to the water's other side. 

At the depiction, you can see this: many people are located at this water and move from one side to the other side. 

In this depiction, working people ah are located at the water and are moving other non-working people. All working people do not use coverings. 

Internally depict this: You are a fighting person and want to come to be killing people of Odawara land. You must have many death tools. Possibly you need to cover your body using a hard protective covering. But when you come to be located at Sakawa water's side, what must you do? Remove the covering or what? When you have many hard things, the movement is not good ah. When water's power comes to be downing you, you cannot be a good aquacreature. Maybe you die! Also, a working person is unable to goodly move you because of this: All of your things are big. The working person is small. Possibly many working people can move you. But this needs time. From the distant large building, people of Odawara land can see this: You are coming. Using that large time, they can come to have all of their fighting tools and can goodly fight you. Otherly, they can go to away. Therefore you cannot kill them. 

#### Three ways of the working people

At this depiction, come to be seeing something other: working people are moving people to the water's other side using which method. Many working people remain located at the Sakawa water's side. When moving people arrive, they can buy their work. 

Three methods exist. The moving person's monetary amount happenizes this: the moving person uses which method. 

Firstly, when a person has not a lot of money and not a lot of power, they buy the work of only one working person. 

The moving person comes to be located at the top of this one working person. The two legs of the moving person are located at the two sides of the head of the working person. Largely possible, the lower leg of the moving person comes to be located in the water. 

This one working person must be bodily powerful ah. Two powers fight this working person. From the above, they must sustain all the downwards power of one person. From the side, the water path moves powerfully. 

Secondly, when a person has money and power, they can buy the work of four people. 

Four working people carry two hard sticks. Two working people are at the front. Two working people are at the back. At the bodily top of the head's side, four working people upwardsly sustain two hard sticks. The two sticks are like a surface. The moving person can rest located at it. 

Possibly a little water comes to be located on this moving person. But using the power of these four people, this movement can be a small moment. The possibility of harm comes to be small.

Thirdly, when a person has much money and much power, they can buy a group of people's labour. 

When a person of much money and much power remains in a very small house, a working group is able to move this house. When you look at the depiction, at your feeling, people of what amount are moving this little house ah? I numbered fourteen people. But I do not know well. When people of a large amount are existing, I can see only a large semisolid of human bodies. I can see this: working people are at the little house's two sides. Are different working people located at the little house's underside too?
