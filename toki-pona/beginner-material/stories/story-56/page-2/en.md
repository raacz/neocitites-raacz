When people of this time speak of Hiroshige's work, one work is very important. The name of his powerful work is this:

"Sights of 43 resting staying locations are located at Big Road Tōkaidō's side." 

or

"Many sights of Big Road Tōkaidō."

This work is a group of amusing depictions and is not just one amusing depiction. (Additionally it is not just one group.)

The Big Road Tōkaidō is what?

In Japan land of the finished time two building places were very powerful ah: Edo building place and Kyoto building place. They both were places of governing buildings. Big Road Tōkaidō unified these two building places. 

From Edo building place, to Kyoto building place. The road was very large. When you moved fast you were able to arrive in seven sun times. But many times the movement needed one moon time. 

Moving lots of a long duration, people needed to rest. Many resting locations existed. In these resting locations people could rest and could buy and could eat and could amuse. 

Lowly people and powerful people and everybody moved using the Big Road Tōkaidō. But they moved using different methods. Lowly people and people of little money moved using feet. Ruling people and powerful people and rich people moved located in a small resting container's insides using the feet of lowly working people. 

Big Road Tōkaidō was located at the big water's side. Additionally, small slices of Big Road Tōkaidō could be located at inside water. Powerful-moving water divided the road at many vicinities. When people wanted to go to the other side, they had to use water-movement tools and working people of strong ah legs. The fighting group did not want this: a hard path is located at the water's above. They felt this: "When bad fighting people want to come to fight me they should fight the water too."

All moving people needed a document of movement possibility from the fighting group. Many fighting people were located at the Tōkaidō road and wanted to see the possibility document. 

In the finished time, Hiroshige came to be having a possibility document and moved from building place Edo to building place Kyoto. All resting places, Hiroshige made one depiction. 

Therefore "Many sights of Big Road Tōkaidō" is a group of many amusing depictions. It is very good ah from the persepctive of many people and brought money to Hiroshige. 

Therefore Hiroshige made "Many sights #2 of Big Road Tōkaidō" and "Many sights #3 of Big Road Tōkaidō" and... ah, amazing. 

Hiroshige made 36 Big Road Tōkaidō depiction groups.
