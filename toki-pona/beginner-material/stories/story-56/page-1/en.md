 Utakawa Hiroshige was a depicting entertainment person and from Japan land. He was from the distant time and is dead at this time, but his work remains. He made lots and lots of depictions ah. 

People are able to make depictions in many different ways. For Hiroshige's drawings he gave lots of colours to a plant-based sheet. But he used a powerful method. 

When people give lots of different colours to a plant-based sheet using their hands, that person is able to make only one document of that depiction. But possibly a person wants to make lots and lots of documents of the same picture. Therefore they can use the hole-block depiction method. At the opening this method was from China land. As the method came to be located in Japan land, many entertainment people of Japan-land changed the method. 

For the hole-block method firstly Hiroshige depicted something using black liquid on a plant-based document. Possibly he drew a young lover woman. 

Secondly he put unifying semisolid to this plant based document and unified the plant based document and the plant based block. At this time the cutting work starts. Hiroshige uses a cutting tool and makes many stringy holes. The many-hole depiction is from the black-liquid depiction. At this time, the depiction of the young lover woman is many holes at a plant-based block's inside. 

Thirdly Hiroshige came to be having a colour-giving tool. This tool is flat-surfacey and round. This tool's under-region has many strings. A person's hand holds the top region and delivers the strings to coloured liquid and powerful moves the string on the plant-based block of many holes. At this time the holed depiction of the young lover woman has a lot of coloured liquid. 

Fourthly Hiroshige gives the front of a new white plant-based sheet towards down to be located at the top of the coloured holed block. He comes to be having a new tool. This is a powerful-transfer tool. The front of this tool is a round hard flat surface. The behind of this tool has a hand-carrying bump. Hiroshige put the flat-surfacy front of the transfer tool on the white plant-based sheet and powerfully moves the transfer tool from one side to the other side. With this, plant-based block's colour transfers well and comes to be located on all of the white sheet. This gives the young lover woman's depiction from the plant-based block to the white sheet. 

Fifthly Hiroshige does everything again. Possible he wants this: The clothing of the young lover woman is bluish. From the beginning Hiroshige draws blue clothing on the plant-based document and cuts it on a plant-based block and gives coloured liquid and provides downwards force. 

Hiroshige can use the same block of the young lover woman of blue clothing on many many documents. Therefore he can make many documents of the same depiction. 

At many times Hiroshige makes depictions of many colours. All colours need big labour because of this: Hiroshige is able to make an only-one-colour depiction using one block-method action.
