Me and my parent want a new flat horizontal surface. 

Therefore me and them went to the structure of the Ikeja business. 

We bought a nice new surface. 

The surface was big and red. 

When the surface was located at our house it was visually good. 

But our animal looked at the big red surface and felt scared. 

The animal roared powerfully and energetically moved strangely and was wanting to battle the surface. 

Ah... bad ah. 

Bad ah so we arrived again at the structure of the Ikeja business. 

We gave back the bad ah red surface to the Ikeja business. 

Ikeja business gave back money to us. 

Good ah! By using the money we buy a small buy surface. 

Our animal is feeling good ah.
