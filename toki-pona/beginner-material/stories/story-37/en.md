I go to Wenon's house at the first time. 

I hear a big-sound animal roar. 

The animal is what?

"This is Linlin." Wenon says. 

"Hello there, O Linlin!"

Linlin big-soundly roars. 

"New people can be scary to them." Wenon says. 

I come to be located at the house's inside.

Linlin is small and wants to move a lot. 

Me and Wenon communicate and amuse. 

However Linlin roars a lot. 

I cannot hear Wenon well. 

But Wenon does not control their animal. 

I speak using a big sound. "Linlin stop your roaring!"

Linlin scared-feelingly roars and comes to be located at Wenon's leg. 

What... the animal is doing what?

"Because of what is your dog wanting to hump your leg?"

"They are feeling scared so they want to feel good so they are humping my leg."

"Is this bad to you?"

"No."

"Strange ah."

"They are an animal so they want to hump so this is not strange."

"An animal-knowledge person can stop its desire to hump."

"I do not want to injure Lilin."

Therefore me and Wenon continued to communicate and continued to amuse as Lilin continued to hump Wenon's leg.
