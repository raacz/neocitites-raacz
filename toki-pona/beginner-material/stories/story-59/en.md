I said this to Mili: I can protect your child. 

Mili sent their child Nona to my home. 

Nono wanted to look at moving pictures using their tool. 

I wanted to amuse. 

I have an amusement tool. The tool is a large hard circular rod. 

"O Nono, do you know this amusement tool ah?"

"I do not want. I want to look at my tool!"

"Therefore I will amuse on just me."

I came to be located at the circular rod's inside. I held the tool in my two hands. I gave force to the tool and removed hands. 

I move my hips in a circular method. The circular rod continued to be on the body and did not move downwards. 

Nono came to be observing. They wanted to amuse.

"I amuse using what method?"

I gave the knowledge to them. 

They circularly moved their hips. But the tool came to be down. 

"I can't!"

"You can. Do again."

Nono did again, and did again.

But, they couldn't. 

"Largely possible your body is small so the circular rod is badly large."

"Bad ah..."

"Will me and you want to buy a small circular rod at a selling building of amusing things?"

"Ah! I want!"
