An entertainment time is at the fish building. 

Three entertainment people make sounds sweetly. 

They use string sound tools and use mouths. 

Many small humans listen and move playfully because of the sound. 

Many fish are watching. 

I look at the fish and the three entertainment people. 

I want to know this: 

Can the fish listen?

Are the fish moving playfully because of the sound?
