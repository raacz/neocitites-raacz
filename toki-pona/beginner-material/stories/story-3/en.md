Come look at the butt surface. It is oh so very small and for this: You are moving outside and need a surface for just a little time. The ‘surface’ is not hard, and is cloth. This is the way: When you do not want to use the surface, close it. When it is closed, three hard sticks exist and are like one big stick. A hard circle unites the three hard sticks in the middle. Red cloth unites the hard sticks at the top. When you want to use the surface, open the surface. With this, three hard sticks stop uniting at the top and the bottom. At the bottom, the three sticks can stay well on the earth. At the top, the three sticks can make the red fabric a surface.

In the past I had another surface of the same system, but its colour was blue. I left it somewhere I don’t know. With this, I needed to buy a new one. I saw it at a small-money store. I bought it for four monies. 

Unfortunately I do not use the surface at many times. When I move outside it is good, but I do this at not many times. Many times, I stay at the inside of my house. Oh, When I see this surface I internally communicate this to myself: I should do movement outside!
