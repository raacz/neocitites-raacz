Myself and Esuwin are moving footily in the plant area. I hear birds and plants and bugs. I hear a loud roar!

"What is that?"

"We should search."

"Maybe it is water of downward movement."

"Perhaps ah."

Us two continue to move and look at a large water of downwards movement. It is powerful downward movement!

"This water is visually poweful!"

"True ah, I want to image you, me and the water using a device."

I have a device in my hand. I am next to Esuwin. The big water is at the behind of us two. I put the image device at the front of us two. 

Three, two, one, do the image!

I look at the image. In the image, the big water, me, and Esuwin are visually good. I feel good.
