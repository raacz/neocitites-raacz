Me and Mano are moving and talking. 

A plant of yellow fruit is at the path's side. 

Mano comes to be having the fruit and just eats the fruit. 

Strange ah! They eat the fruit's skin too. 

"You are doing what, O Mano!"

They do not speak. They continue to eat. 

The entirety of that fruit comes to be located at jan Mano. 

I am looking at what ah?!

The strange eating is done. Mano communicates. 

"This fruit is so good to me."
