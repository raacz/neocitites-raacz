I move powerfully in a land of many buildings. 

I sleep at a bad time. I need to go to the knowledge structure!

Something strange moves downwards and fights my head. 

What ah? I stop the movement.

The thing is what? It is clothing!

It comes from where? I search using eyes. 

A string of many clothes is located at upwards. 

The clothes continue to be on the string using holding tools. 

But the holding tool of one of the clothes is broken. 

Bad. The string is at the top. I am at the bottom.

I cannot re-send the clothing to the top. Time does not exist. 

I do not labour. I go away.
