## Power liquid and the Mormon divine path

The not-dead Joseph Smith said this at many times: the Divine gave new knowledge to me. 

When 28 years were at Joseph Smith, the divine person said this to him:

Your group should be bodily good. Therefore do not consume intoxicating liquid. Do not heat plants in a consuming way. Do not consume hot liquid. Eat bread and fruit and animals. Move the body. 

Joseph Smith communicated like many people of bodily knowledge. Largely possible Joseph Smith listened to people of bodily knowledge and made the divine communication from real knowledge. 

Lots of his communication is good or what? Intoxicating liquid is bad to the body. When people consume air from the heating of plants, this is able ah to destroy the consumption ability of good air. But... hot liquid is what? In what context is hot liquid bad?

## Hot liquid is not hot liquid

"Hot liquid" does not communicated all hot liquids. Importantly these words communicate two liquids: Firstly, dark power liquid is from small hard black fruits. When you consume it the sleepy feeling leaves. Secondly, plant power liquid is from plant sheets. When you consume it the sleeping feeling leaves. These two liquids minimize the sleepy feeling so 'hot liquid' is not a good name. Possibly 'evil liquid of sleepiness removal' is a good name. 

Is evil liquid of sleepiness removal bad to the body? When you consume a lot a lot a lot a lot, it can summon a bad feeling. But no people of bodily knowledge believe this: You should not eat liquid of sleepiness removal.

But the Divine communicated the evilness of these two liquids to Joseph Smith and impossibled the consumption of these liquids so the people of the Mormon divine path continue to not ah consume it. When people consume the evil liquid they cannot come to be located in a powerful divine building of the Mormon divine path. They cannot come to be lovingly united of another person, in the Mormon divine path. When a person consumes this liquid, in the context of this divine path, that person is dirty.
