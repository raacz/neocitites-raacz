## Power liquid and the Mormon divine path

The not-dead Joseph Smith said this at many times: the Divine gave new knowledge to me. 

When 28 years were at Joseph Smith, the divine person said this to him:

Your group should be bodily good. Therefore do not consume intoxicating liquid. Do not heat plants in a consuming way. Do not consume hot liquid. Eat bread and fruit and animals. Move the body. 

Joseph Smith communicated like many people of bodily knowledge. Largely possible Joseph Smith listened to people of bodily knowledge and made the divine communication from real knowledge. 

Lots of his communication is good or what? Intoxicating liquid is bad to the body. When people consume air from the heating of plants, this is able ah to destroy the consumption ability of good air. But... hot liquid is what? In what context is hot liquid bad?

## Hot liquid is not hot liquid

"Hot liquid" does not communicated all hot liquids. Importantly these words communicate two liquids: Firstly, dark power liquid is from small hard black fruits. When you consume it the sleepy feeling leaves. Secondly, plant power liquid is from plant sheets. When you consume it the sleeping feeling leaves. These two liquids minimize the sleepy feeling so 'hot liquid' is not a good name. Possibly 'evil liquid of sleepiness removal' is a good name. 

Is evil liquid of sleepiness removal bad to the body? When you consume a lot a lot a lot a lot, it can summon a bad feeling. But no people of bodily knowledge believe this: You should not consume liquid of sleepiness removal.

But the Divine communicated the evilness of these two liquids to Joseph Smith and impossibled the consumption of these liquids so the people of the Mormon divine path continue to not ah consume it. When people consume the evil liquid they cannot come to be located in a powerful divine building of the Mormon divine path. They cannot come to be lovingly united of another person, in the Mormon divine path. They cannot look at the loving unification of other people in the Mormon divine path. When a person consumes this liquid, in the context of this divine path, that person is dirty. 

## What is possible and not possible

Hot liquids of sleep removal, people of the Mormon divine path cannot consume. But cold liquids of sleep removal, are the people of the Mormon divine path able?

In the nearby time many people not of the Mormon divine path have colded the two hot liquids of sleep removal and have consumed this cold liquid. This method does not good the evil. The liquid is cold or hot, well the evilness remains. People of the Mormon divine path cannot consume this. 

But people of the Mormon divine path are able to consume a different cold liquid of sleepiness removal. 

Many liquids exist and have a small strange sleepingess-removal thing, like the two evil liquids. At many times these liquids are very sweet. The very-rich large business group Coca-Cola makes lots of sweet liquids and gives the small strange sleepiness-removal thing to all ah. Many business groups produce like this. 

The small strange thing of sleepiness-removal is not only at liquid. It is located at lots of sweet food too. Additionally you can buy sleepiness-removal medication and can consume only the small strange thing ah. 

Is food/eating of this small strange thing, bad to people of the Mormon divine path? At one time, many people of the Mormon divine path communicated this: leave all sleepiness-removal things. They are all bad ah. But at the present time, no person feels like this. Many people of the Mormon divine path consume this small strange thing in sweet cold liquid, in medicinal hard things, and in non-liquid sweet food too.
