### Divine buildings of the Mormon divine path

At this time you know this: strange rules are in the Mormon divine path. Using what method, the ruling group of the Mormon divine path is able to make-arrive this: people obey the rules?

I come to be communicating. But first, know the method of buildings.

#### Buildings of two customs exist

Many divine paths exist and use buildings of different customs. 

Many people of not the Mormon divine path are at America-land and feel this: the small person of the parental divine person died on a stick and goodened all people using a strange exchange method. At time, people of this feeling go to divine buildings at all weeks. People are able to go to divine buildings of their desire. They can go to near buildings. They can go to far buildings. Nothing controls this: a person is able to go to which divine building. 

But the Mormon divine path's group controls a lot. They communicate this to all people: they are able to go to which single divine building. This is the method:

The ruling group looks at a land paper and largely cuts it. All large land divisions have one important ruling person. 

Again, the ruling group smally cuts all of the large land divisions. All of the small divisions have one divine building. At this divine building, the people of the Mormon divine path of this small land division go at all weeks. This is the divine building of small groups. 

But when two people come to be lovingly and legally unified in the Mormon divine path, this action cannot come to be at a small group's divine building. 

They need to go to the powerful divine building. 

Powerful divine buildings are white and very large and very visually expensive and are located at not all places. At the powerful divine building the people of the Mormon divine path feel this: They can work divinely. 

Therefore only good people can go to the powerful divine building's insides. 

Which people are good people? Not all people of the Mormon divine path are good of a good amount from the perspective of the ruling group. When you want to come to be a good person from the perspective of the group, a small ruling person of your small divine building must communicate this: you are good. 

#### These good people are good of a good amount

A document exists and says this: When a person wants to be good, goodness of a good amount is like what. 

These good people feel this: the Mormon divine path is true. The first important leader of the ruling group is divinely powerful. 

These good people go to the divine building on the day of the divine path. 

These good people have sex in the only good method of the Mormon divine path. 

These good people use only the good covering method of the Mormon divine path. 

These good people don't communicate untruly. 

When these good people make-arrive money, they give one money from ten moneys to the divine path's group. 

These good people are 'bodily good' and do not consume bad liquid. 

Additional things are in the document. But I communicated all the important things. 

When you want to come to be unified lovingly to a person of the Mormon divine path, or when you want to be able to go to the good divine land of the Mormon divine path, you need to do all of these things.
