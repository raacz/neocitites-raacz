## Joseph Smith opened the path

Joseph Smith's divine path is a slightly-new divine path. 

Joseph Smith's parent emitted him at the 1805th year at the section-land Vermont of America-land. 

In the time of Joseph Smith many people of American-land created new divine paths. Truly, the work of Joseph Smith was not very abnormal. 

### Two sights of Joseph Smith

For Joseph Smith, two important things came and existed. 

Firstly, when Joseph Smith was young, the Divine spoke to him. He was in a plant area when two divine people of strange power came to be located in his eyesight. 

The first person was the Parental Divine. 

The second person was this Smaller Divine: they were very good and the child of the Parental Divine and died horribly on a stick and happily arrived again from death so due to a strange exchange, all of the coming time can come to be good like them. 

The two people of his front said this: All the divine paths of this time are broken. Joseph Smith must make again the good divine path of the finished time. 

Secondly, the Parental Divine's birdish working person came to Joseph Smith and said this: the divine book is located at the under of earth at this vicinity. Make a hole and come to obtain the divine book. 

Joseph Smith made a hole and came to have the divine book. The divine book was from yellow expensive metal and very old. The divine book used a unfamiliar language of the ancient time. 

But the Divine gave the power of language changing to Joseph Smith so he could come to be able to look at the communication. He languagely transformed the book. This is Mormon's book. 

### Mormon's Book

Mormon's book says this:

In the finished time many people left from the divine land Jerusalem and went to the land of the American nation. When the smaller god died horribly and good-transaction-weirdnessly on a stick and arrived again from death, they went to the land of America nation and did lots of different things there. 

Mormon's book communicates all the actions of this time on these first people: they came to the land of America nation.

At the existing time, knowledge-searching people know a lot about groups of the finished time because of this: they looked a lot at earth and really searched for things of the finished time at that earth's under. The knowledge-searching people say this:

The first people of this land were not from the divine land Jerusalem. Joseph Smith's book can't be true communication. 

However truly many people believe this: Joseph Smith communicated true. Joseph Smith became a ruling person of his divine path. People not of this divine path communicated Joseph Smith's divine path using words "Mormon divine path", from the the name of the divine book. 

### Joseph Smith's death

Joseph Smith was a ruling person not just of a divine path. He became a ruling person of land. He wanted to come to be the first ruler of America land. 

But he did not come to be the first ruler of America land. He came to be dead. 

Understand this: Joseph Smith was bad. One of his bad projects, he horribly had sex with many many many feminine people and covered this knowledge from their men and from all the group people. A small group of his divine path came to know his bad deeds and spoke of all his badness in a boook and gave the book to many people. When Joseph Smith destroyed the book-making house many ruling people of nearby lands came to be wanting to battle him. 

Joseph Smith came to be located at a bad-people container. Many people felt bad and came to be knowing this: Joseph Smith was located where. A large group of people of bad feelings came and killed Joseph Smith. 

### The continuation method

In Joseph Smith's death, the Mormon divine path community continued and continues at this time. 

At the time of Joseph Smith many people said this: The Divine has communicated to me! Listen to me ah! Many people made divine paths like Joseph Smith. But not many paths continue to exist and continue to be a large group of people like the Joseph Smith's Mormon divine path. 

The Mormon divine path is a divine path of much control. The Mormon divine path bans many actions. In this document I want to communicate many of the Mormon divine path's rules.
