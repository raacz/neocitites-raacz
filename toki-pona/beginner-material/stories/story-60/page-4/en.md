### Large building of many buying rooms

In the finished document you came to be knowing this:

When people of the Mormon divine path want to come to be located at the powerful divine building's insides, they must give a money portion of work money to the divine group. 

Many different divine paths say this: Deferential people should give money. But in the Mormon divine path, when you do not give money, the ruling people disallow many actions. In the Mormon divine path, the need to give is very big. If you do not give, you are bad. Therefore many people give. Many people with lots of money give. Many people with not a lot of money give. 

#### Money of the Mormon divine path

Not strangely, the ruling group of the Mormon divine path is very very very very very very rich. What amount? Truly, we cannot know. 

In America-land, business groups must communicate this to the ruling group: they summoned money of what amount. But large groups of divine paths are able to not communicate this: they summoned money of what amount. 

Therefore the Mormon group's money amount is covered knowledge. Only ruling people of a lot of power are knowing this number. 

Many people want to know this covered knowledge. Therefore they hunt the knowledge using many different methods. At this time many people feel this: the covered-knowledge money amount is very similar to the money amount of this person: they made the Amazon business group.

That is a lot, lot of money ah. The Mormon divine path's group is doing what using this money?

They make new small divine buildings and new powerful divine buildings. They give a little money towards the benefit of lowly people. 

Additionally, they made a large building of lots of shopping rooms at a large powerful divine building's side. 

#### The powerful divine buiding of first bigness

At the portioned land Utah of land America, the building land of 'seasoned water' has people of the first amount. 'Seasoned water' is the land's name. 

Additionally, in the portioned land Utah, people of the Mormon divine path are the first amount. Not strangely, the powerful divine building of the first bigness of the Mormon divine path is located at the building land of 'seasoned water' ah. 

But slightly strangely, a large shopping building is at the large  powerful divine building's side. This shopping building is very large and has many small shopping buildings. 

The ruling group of the Mormon divine path made the large powerful divine building and the large building of many shopping buildings too. 

At the large shopping building, people can buy bad liquid. 

At the large shopping building, people can buy these coverings: in the Mormon divine path, they insufficiently cover feminine arms and feminine legs. 

The ruling group of the Mormon path built a large shopping building. In the large shopping building, people can do these things: they are bad ah from the perspective of the Mormon divine path. 

In the context of what, the ruling group did construct this shopping building? Because of money. What else is a possibility.

In the beginning the ruling group communicated this:

O everyone, at the side of the powerful divine building, we want to construct a very large shopping building. This can be bad from your perspective so do know this: When you give a portion of your work money to us, we will not use that money in the making of the big shopping building. When we make the large shopping building, we will use other money. 

The ruling group did not communicate this: The other money was from what.
