### Joseph Smith evily had sex with many women

In the Mormon divine path, women are lowly at many times at many different methods. I want to communicate two methods of these many methods. 

#### Ability of divine power

Joseph Smith gave this knowledge:

Using the ability of divine power, a person is able to do good divine work. A person is able to improve a negative bodily quality. A person is able to come to be martially powerful. 

But from the perspective of Joseph Smith, not all people can come to be having the ability of divine power. Women are unable ah. Men only are able ah. 

When small masculine people circle the sun at twelve times, they come to be able to have the ability of divine power. 

The giving method is this: a powerfully divine group of large masculine people give their hands to the head-top of the small masculine person. They say many words. 

At this time, the small masculine person comes to be having a small ability of divine power. When the small masculine person is big, he is able to go to the powerful divine building and is able to come to have the full ability of divine power. 

For a large time, the ruling group gave the ability of divine power to masculine people of only white appearance. People of dark appearance were unable. At the 1978th year, the ruling group abilitied dark people. 

Continually, feminine people are unable to have the ability of divine power ah. 

#### Method of love unity

In the Mormon divine path, love unification is very important. They feel this: when you and your love person come to be lovingly unified in a powerful divine building, you two will remain at nearby for all of the arriving time, at death, at the end of death too. 

Masculine people and feminine people. Only these can be lovingly unified. A feminine person cannot be lovingly unified to another feminine person. A masculine person cannot be lovingly unified to another masculine person. From the perspective of the Mormon divine path, nonbinary people do not exist. 

However. One masculine person can be unified to many feminine people. A feminine person can by unified to only one masculine person. 

#### Joseph Smith and his lots of evil sex

He covered his evil sex using many different methods. At many times, he used this method:

Joseph Smith communicated this to a lowly masculine person: Go to a very far land. I want this: you distribute the Mormon divine path to many people of the far land and enlarge the group. 

The lowly person obeys and leaves. 

When he is gone, Joseph Smith came to the woman of that lowly masculine person and communicated this:

O woman, the Divine person wants this: you and I come to be lovingly unified. You must come to be lovingly unified to me. When you do not do this, a labouring bird person of the Divine parent will kill me using a large fighting stick. 

The woman could only obey. At the end of the sex, Joseph Smith said this to the woman: cover this knowledge from all other people. 

He used many other methods. At times, he would have sex with small feminine people using communication of the same method. 

With all of these, Joseph Smith covered from his divine-path community. He covered these acts from his woman also. 

But at a time, Emma came to be knowing. Emma was Joseph Smith's first feminine love person. Emma came to be knowing because of this:

A new small feminine person came to be staying in the house of Joseph Smith. Largely possible, this small feminine person was a labour person. But Joseph Smith and Emma sustained this small feminine person and were like parents to her. Emma felt very parental. 

At one night, Emma came to be located at the side of the animal house and heard Joseph Smith and the small feminine child. Using a small hole of the building's front, Emma saw. 

Emma removed the small feminine person from the house. 

#### A new bad method of love unification

For a large time, Joseph Smith communicated this to his group: I am having sex with only one person. I speak truly!

(He spoke untruly)

But he was unable to continue to cover his actions. Therefore Joseph Smith communicated this: All of my bad actions were not bad because of this: God wanted it. 

In a document, Joseph Smith wrote this communication from the Divine:

"I am the Divine. 

For a large time I have allowed this: A masculine person can come to be unified to many love women. I give this ability to Joseph Smith also. Truly, I give this ability to all masculine people. When a masculine person wants to lovingly unify to multiple women, he can. But use this method:

The masculine person should communicate this to the first woman: he wants to have sex with a new woman. 

The first woman should allow the new sex. But when a woman disallows the sex, I will destroy that evil first woman. 

The new woman should be new to sex. When she has sex in the finished time and coveres this knowledge from the masculine person, I will destroy that evil new woman. 

When a masculine person and many women are unified, my community can be very big. This is good to me. To masculine people of many women, I will give a lot of goodness in the divine place."

#### Method of the present time

At the present time, people of the Mormon divine path dismiss the method of the finished time. One feminine person and one masculine person, only they can be lovingly united. 

But when a feminine person dies, when the masculine person lovingly unites again to a new person, the masculine person is able to be located next to two women in the divine death place. 

When a masculine person dies, when a feminine person lovingly unites again to a new masculine person, the feminine person will be located next to only the second masculine person in the divine place. 

Only death can finish a love unification. Possibly a masculine person and a feminine person are lovingly unified and come to be feeling conflicty and want to remove the love unification. They can finish the legal love unification. But they cannot finish the divine love unification. 

Possibly a masculine person of love unification acts badly and harms a feminine person. The feminine person wants to leave and leaves and comes to love a new masculine person and wants to lovingly unify. The feminine person and new masculine person can legally lovingly unify, but they cannot divinely lovingly unify. People of the Mormon divine path feel this: when the feminine person dies, she must be located at her bad masculine person's side for all of the arriving time, located away from her new masculine person for all of the arriving time. 

Bad ah.
