An artistic person made a stone. 

The stone depicts this:

A bad governing person killed the feminine person's good person. 

The feminine person felt bad a lot. 

The group put the good dead person's body to a earthy hole. 

A big stone closed the earthy hole. 

Three days arrived and left. 

The feminine person wanted to feel bad at the dead body's side. 

She went to the earthy hole. 

But the large stone was removed. The hole was open. 

The feminine person saw this: Her good dead person was not dead.
