I make the food. 

You and I eat the food. 

You improve the dirty eating tools. 

A good method is this: me and you trade the labour. 

Food making is bad to you. 

Dirtiness-removal work is bad to me. 

When I am only one, I am lowly. 

When you are only one, you are lowly.

But in a group, you and I are powerful.
