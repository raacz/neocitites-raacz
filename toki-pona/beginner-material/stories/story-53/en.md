A human depiction is next to a human depiction. 

The first depiction is flat. A fighting person is located at a plant area. He has a fighting tool. Small-duration cloth houses are located at his side. 

The second depiction is hard. A hard white form is like a human and has hands, legs, and a body. It's front is only white and does not have a mouth and eyes. The fighting person's clothing is on the hard form. 

The flat depiction or the hard depiction is firstly similar to a human?

When I use only my eyes the flat depiction is firstly similar. 

But when I use only my hands the hard depiction is firstly similar. 

Ah, so because of this the working people of the knowledge building placed the two depictions together!
