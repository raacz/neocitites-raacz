Two knowledgable black birds squawk:

First bird: I have a hard stick of a dead body. 

Second bird: The hard thing is from what?

First bird: The hard thing is from a bird. 

Second bird: Which bird?

First bird: This bird cannot go to the sky. 

Second bird: Therefore the hard thing is from a beast, and not from a bird.
