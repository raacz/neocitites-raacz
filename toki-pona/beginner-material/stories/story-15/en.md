I see a water bird. 

The bird is resting on the earth. 

Dead plants are at the bird's sides. 

I come to be located at the bird's front. 

I quack. The bird quacks. 

The bird doesn't feel scared. Good!

My container has bread. I give the bread to the bird. 

I hear quack quack quack quack quack quack quack at my back. 

I spirally move. 

Ha ha ha!

A large group of many birds wants my bread ah.
