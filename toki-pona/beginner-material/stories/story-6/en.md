I move using my feet. 

I see many large hills. I see a lot of white. I see no people. I see no structures. 

My feet hurt. I want to rest. 

But I feel cold. I cannot rest. 

I move. I move. I move. 

I see a small dark structure. 

Ah, the Divine is good!

Someone provides a structure, warmth, and food. 

I rest well. 

The coming day, I move.
