At nighttime, I am on a sleeping surface. 

I want to sleep. But I hear a destructive sound. 

"O Parent! I hear a scary roar!"

Parent does not hear me. They do something other. 

Bad ah. I feel bad! I hear again the destructive sound. 

Very very bad ah. 

I move from the sleeping surface. I search for Parent. 

Parent is on their sleeping surface and feeling scared. 

They look at me. They feel good.

"The powerful sound of upper water emittance is scary!" My parent says.
