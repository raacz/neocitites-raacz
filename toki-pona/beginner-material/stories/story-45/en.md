Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I want to feel good at the water's side. 

But many many many many many people are present!

I want to feel the air of the big water. 

But I feel the gross air of other people. 

I want to see my book. 

But I see many uncovered people. 

I want to hear the pleasant bird chirping. 

But I hear the gross chirping of children. 

The amount of people is badly large to me. 

I cannot remain. 

I need to leave!
