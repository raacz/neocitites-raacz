The dark time is here.   
  
In a plant place, one person of negative feelings wants to bring about goodness using this strange divine-work method:   
  
O good large moon,  
I communicate to you.  
  
May the new feminine divine come to me.   
May the parental feminine divine come to me.   
May the old feminine divine come to me.   
  
  
O good large sun,  
I communicate to you.  
  
May the new masculine divine come to me.   
May the parental masculine divine come to me.   
May the old masculine divine come to me.   
  
O this good earth,  
I communicate to you.  
  
May the new androgyne divine come to me.   
May the parental androgyne divine come to me.   
May the old androgyne divine come to me.   
  
The new and the parental and the old are a circle.   
The moon and the sun and the earth are a circle.   
In a circle, negative and positive exchange.   
  
May all arrive.   
May all take action.   
May all listen.   
  
This is my desire:  
May my group not be badly defeated.
