In the cold time, many people move using big tools. 

But I travel using legs. I do not have a large moving tool. I don't know how to use a large moving tool. 

When white semisolid comes from the sky the workers of the ruling group remove the white semisolid from the tool path using little time. Unfortunately, the same workers do not remove semisolid from the foot-movement path. 

When I am the first moving person I need to make a path using my feet ah!

But many times I am not the first moving person. I am able to move on this path: other people moved in the finished time. 

I feel good because of this: many other people are like me and move footily in the cold time. The ruling groups acts like this: I do not exist. But we all exist and continue to move using feet ah!
