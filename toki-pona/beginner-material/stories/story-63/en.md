A person wants to make a good movement image. 

They have many large containers. 

The many large containers have lots of work tools of good movement images. 

Two tools give powerful light. Two of these tools are circles. One of these tools is a stick. 

One tool makes the movement image. This tool has a powerful eye. This tool is very valuable ah. 

Many small tools can nicely hear sound. The person comes towards me. They have a hearing tool. They transfer the hearing tool to my coverings. The tool can nicely hear my communication. 

The person communicates to me: "Vocalize. I want to know the sound's goodness."

I vocalize. "Vocalizing vocalizing!"

The person listens. They feel bad. They work. 

The person communicates to me. "Vocalize again."

I vocalize again. "Vocalizing vocalizing vocalizing!"

The person listens. They feel good. "Good ah. At this time we can start."

They are at the image tool's behind. I am at the image tool's front. 

The person says: "Communicate this: You make what amusements?"
