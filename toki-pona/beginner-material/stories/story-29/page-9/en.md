I add the circly vegetable food and white sheet and red paste and green paste to one bread. 

I add the white paste and plants and red liquidy fruit and eye-liquid fruit to another bread. 

I give the two breads and vegetable sticks and yellow paste to an eating surface.

I unite the first bread and the second bread. 

I give the food to my mouth. I open my mouth. Eating is starting!
