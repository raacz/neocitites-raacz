The masculine person of the divine Sikhi path does start-of-day labour. 

He improves his first-thing big string using the second-thing string improvement tool. He covers all the string and the string improvement tool in a circle. 

His hand has the third-thing metal circle. His loins have the fourth-thing internal leggy covering. 

The fifth-thing fighting tool is at his side. 

He has everything. The start-of-day labour is complete. He goes!
