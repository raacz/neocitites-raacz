I get rid of sleep and feel a need for movement. I come from my house and move a lot in the outdoors. 

For a large time, I only move. I do not eat and do not rest and do not communicate and do not labour. 

I am at where a? I do not know. Which time is existing? Also this I do not know.  

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

Ah, what is that! I look at a large time tool. It is a circle and big ah. It is located low and is from colourful earth plants!

A person depicted numbers using plants. All the time numbers ah! They are in a slightly strange circle. 

Three large sticks are at the circle's center. I come to know the time using the tool.

The time of the third large eating will arrive in the near time. 

Ah, I ought to travel again to my home. I ought to eat something. 

Very strange ah... Which person made that time tool?
