At their house of much value the ruling person of a big land felt unamusingly. They had lots of food and lots of women. Food and women are very good. If food and women were only, everything would be well. However, no ah. The ruling person of a big land ought to also work. They ought to end a large evil of the proximal time. 

At the proximal time, a bluish reptile came to be located at many small building lands and killed many people using mouth fire emittence. The ruling person communicated towards many knowledgeable people. No person knew this: The reptile came from what and wants what. However all people knew this: the reptile is very very ah powerful. Because of the ruling person's desire, many fighting people have tried to fight the reptile and have come to be humbled and have died. 

Truly, when many fighting people die this is not very bad from the perspective of the ruling person. Many fighting people died. But many many many many many many many fighting people exist. The ruling person communicated this to the fighting group: Continue to send new fighting people to the bad bluish reptile! When those new fighting people die send new fighting people also!

"Bad ruling person ah!" This is the feeling of the fighting human Wen. The fighting group communicated this to them: You must fight the reptile. Wen knows this: they do not want to die. However this fighting person cannot fight the will of the fighting group. They can't not go. They can't not die. 

Or what? Wen communicated internally. Possibly a no-death method exists. Possibly a very strange no-death method exists!

The reptile is located at a distant land. At the sun time Wen went towards the reptile using an animal. At the dark time Wen made a no-death method. Three sun times came and left. Wen completed the work at the no-death method. At the coming sun time, Wen will come to be located at the reptile. 

 At one dark time, they can rest. They look at the dark sky of many small white night-sky objects. They look at the land and... a part of a house. In the finished time, the house exists. But the reptile destructively fired it. A dark black bird comes towards the part of a house and caws and begins consumption. Wen cannot see well. However, destuction... Largely possible, the bird is eating a dead human body. 

Fighting person Wen is a no-good fighting person. They cannot protect people. They cannot humble the reptile. They sleep in bad feelings. 

At the start of the next sun time Wen sought out the reptile. They came to see the reptile. The reptile came to see them. Wen had a fighting tool in one hand and had a protecting tool in the other hand. They moved forward.
