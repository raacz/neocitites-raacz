When fighting person Wen was not a fighting person and only a small person, they were a slightly strange small person. They came to be big at a building land of many many people ah. Many small people were located at nearby and wanted to amuse. But Wen did not want to amuse at the sides of those small people. Wen wanted to amuse at the working room of their masculine parent. 

When the feminine parent came to be emitting Wen, a bodily destruction, so the feminine parent came to be dead. Wen did not know the feminine parent. But they did know the masculine parent. 

From the perspective of small person Wen, Father was the person of the first goodness. He was firstly amusing, and firstly knowledgeable, and firstly powerful, and firstly divine. That was because of this: the father knew a lot about the method of thing-heating. 

"Come to be looking at this!"

That was Father's communication at many times. At all times, Wen heard that communication and knew this: they were coming to be seeing something amazing. Using little time they would go to the parent's side. 

"The new is what?"

Wen's father holds one large liquid container and one small liquid container. 

"Know this: lots of liquid can destroy things. But all destructive liquids are different methods. They are different colours and destroy different things using power of different amounts."

"You are coming to be destroy what using those two liquids ah?"

Father amused. "Valuable yellow metal!"

"In the context of what could you want to destroy valuable yellow metal ah! Don't be obscene. Money is good ah. Do not destroy!"

"I communicated 'destroy.' I didn't communicate this: I get rid of the yellow metal."

"What ah!"

"Do come to be looking. The ruling person gave this circle of yellow metal to me."

Father came to be having a yellow metal using a tool. Using the tool, he transfered the yellow metal towards the first liquid container. 

Wen looked intensely. Nothing arrived. 

Father removed the yellow metal from the liquid and transfered it to cloth. Heat came! The yellow metal slightly ate the cloth. 

"Ah, this is liquid of cloth consumption or what? It doesn't consume the yellow metal because of this: the metal is strong. But the cloth is weak so the consumption is possible or what?"

"Like that."

Father came to again have the yellow metal and transfered it to the second container. Wen looked intensely. At an again time, nothing arrived. 

Father removed the yellow metal from the liquid. His hand searched for a second circle of yellow metal. 

"This yellow metal is not from the ruling person. I bought it at a market of money people."

Father transferred a little liquid to the working surface, and placed the yellow metal at this liquid. Heat! Movement and air release arrived. The father removed the second yellow metal from the liquid.

Wen really wanted to know. "Ah, what arrived?"

"The first yellow metal is good and is from only good yellow valuable metal. The second liquid is unable to destroy things of only good yellow valuable metal. Therefore the second yellow metal is not from only good yellow valuable metal. Unpure metal too is present."

"Ah. For a little time, I felt this: The first yellow metal was bad. The second yellow metal was good."

"Truly, different. But you can see this or what: the first liquid is unable to destroy the yellow metal. The second liquid is able to destroy the unpure metal, but it cannot destroy the yellow metal."

"When we unite these two liquids, what?"

"You are adorable. You understand well." The father made an amusement noise. "But I need to unite them using a mathematical method. When I give one portion of the first liquid and one portion of the second liquid, no good. When I want to create a yellow-metal destructive liquid, the method is this: give three portions of the first liquid and one portion of the second liquid. Do you want to watch this: I work?"

"Want."

"Hm. But do you want to work?"

"Ah, can I?"

"Can. But work well. The creation of these two liquids uses a large moment. When you unite the two liquids no colour should be present. However, when a small moment arrives and leaves, the liquid comes to be a little bit red. When the liquid is red, it cannot destroy well the yellow valuable metal."

Totally amusing. Good ah! From the perspective of small person Wen, this method was amusing. 

But at this time, big fighting person Wen had a no-amusement feeling. Darkness. No sound. Bad feeling. The back of the head feels very bad. Everything feels bad. Bad feeling. Hot feeling. Broken... Sleep desire...

At the inside of their head, Wen heard Father's mouth sound. 

"Do not die. The deathly reptile left. But bad animals of eating desire remain at the vicinity. Move. Do not sleep."

"I can't. I want to sleep."

"That is not strange. For a large time you did not sleep. You foraged for plants and semisolided the plants and hunted for stone and semisolided the stone and made lots of different liquids and lots of different semisolids and united them in a strange method for only this: you can make a goo of heat destruction."

"Truly I acted like you. When you exist, you work searchingly at all times and sleep at no times."

"This is true. But my work killed me. Your work removed your death."

"O Father, I worked well or what?"

"Truly, good work. But the work is not complete. Move. Do not sleep."

"I feel this: I didn't work well. When I transfered the goo of heat destruction to my skin, my skin should have completely destroyed the heat. But I can feel this: Actually, the heat slightly destroyed the back of my head. The goo should protect me. But it acted not-all-good."


At a small moment, Wen felt the desire to die. But a representation of Father came to their vision. 

In the representation, Father's clothing was totally black, but one strange large cloth of many colors was lots of circles at his head's underneath. Green dirtiness was at his face. His hand held a emittance tool of destructive liquid. He emitted the liquid to the green fire. 

Ah, this represented this moment: Father came to be dead. 

I don't want to be like him. I don't want to die because of fire. 

Wen opened from sleep.
