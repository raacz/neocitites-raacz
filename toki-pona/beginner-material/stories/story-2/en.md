My parent has a tool.

The tool can make an image.

The tool is very valuable.

I want to use the tool.

But, my parent does not want this. 

I wait, I wait, I wait. 

At this time, my parent is not watching. I go to the tool. I want to come to have the tool.

But the tool is big! My hands are small.

The tool goes down. Destruction, oh!
