I am an animal head. 

Destruction ah! 

My body went where?

My two front legs went where?

My two back legs went where?

I don't know. I do not see them. 

Big destruction ah!

I can't go. 

I can't hunt. 

I can't fight. 

I am powerless. 

O My Legs...

O My Body...

Come again to me. 

When you are not existing, I am no animal!
