Kuto's parent has a waste land. 

"Something powerful is at the waste land." jan Kuto says. 

"It is what?" 

"Something powerful. I want to give it to your vision."

I and Kuto go to the waste land alongside. Kuto gives a mouth covering to me.

"Cover your mouth because of this: Waste air can be bad to the body." Kuto says. 

The waste land is large and has lots of hard waste. Hard sticks and hard surfaces and hard tools and hard strings are at all sides. 

Kuto continues to move. I move at their back. 

"Something powerful is located at where?" I say. 

Kuto opens the door of a trashed white movement tool. 

"Look!"

"Ah!"

At the trashed structure's insides, a parental animal and seven of its little animals are sleeping pleasantly alongside.
