I see a fruit. I do not know the fruit. 

The fruit is a little yellowish and a little greenish and visually good. 

I buy the new fruit. 

I come to be at my house. 

I divide the kili. 

I eat this fruit using what method?

Are the little hard black circles food?

I want to come to know.

I mouth the dark circles. 

Ah, new knowledge of a new fruit:  
The dark circles are not food!
