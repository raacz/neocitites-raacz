I want to protect my body. 

Sickliness can kill my body. Badness can kill my body. 

I do not want sickliness or badness. I don't want to die. 

I go to a person of body knowledge. They give a protecting liquid to the inside of my hand. 

"At this time, your body is coming to be knowing the sickliness and badness. In the arriving time, your body can fight the sickliness and badness."

Good. I want a body of good fighting ability.
