Me and many people are in a water moving tool. 

We all want to see big  aquacreatures. 

Are the big aquacreatures present?

We all look. The big aquacreatures are at where?

For a large time no big aquacreatures are present. 

One small person is feeling tired and says this:

"O Parent, the aquacreatures aren't present so I'm feeling bad!"

The parent says this:

"Unfortunately all the aquacreatures are sleeping. Sleep similarly in my arms."
