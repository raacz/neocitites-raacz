I am at English land. I want to see the house of the ruling person. 

At the ruling house's side I see a working person. The working person is a person of the fighting group. They protect the ruling person of English land. 

They are very visually strange. Their body coverings are red. Their head covering is black and very large!

They do not speak. They do not rest. They hold a death tool and intensely look towards the front.

I continue to observe them. I want to know. They are feeling what? Do they feel tired? Do they feel bad?

For time of what largeness do they need to continue to work? Which time are they able to stop and able to rest?

The working person is able to not move for at a long time. They are powerful. 

I am not powerful. I need to often move my body. I cannot come to be a protecting working person of the fighting group in the English land.
