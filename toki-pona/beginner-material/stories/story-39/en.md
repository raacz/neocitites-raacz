I love a new person

The new person loves me. 

I feel good because of new love. 

One time the new love person says:

"My parents are wanting to come to be knowing you.

They want to buy day-starting food for you."

Oh. I feel scared. 

"Your parents are frightening to me."

"My parents do not want to be bad. Do not feel scared."

Me and the new love person go to the eating building.

"O Iko, these are my two parents.

O two parents, this is Iko."

"Hello!" I feel scared.

The first parent says. "Hello, O Iko. Younger person has spoken a lot about your many virtues."

The second parent says. "You come to know many languages or what?"

"This is correct. I am coming to know hand language and the Esperanto language."

The second parent says. "When I was a young person I came to know the Esperanto language!"

My scared feeling disappears. 

Me and the second parent communicate a lot using the Esperanto language. 

My love person and first parent listen and have amusement. 

We all eat well.
