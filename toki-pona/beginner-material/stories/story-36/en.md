Many dead fish are at the market. 

Many dead fish are looking at me. 

Oh. Truly they are not looking at me. They are dead. 

When dead they cannot see and cannot know. But ah. 

Eyes of the fish are open. I can feel the gaze of the dead fish. 

When fish are dead, their spirits go to what?

Do good fish spirits go to the elated place? Do bad fish spirits go to the under place? Do fish spirits stay at the earth and look at me?

As Buddhists say do fish spirits cycle again and come again to the earth in a human body or a bird body or an amphibian body or an insect body or a mammal body?

Possibly in another cycle I was a dead fish. 

But it's largely possible the fish's spirit only disappears. 

Largely possible the dead fishes do not feel bad or good or whiteness or blackness. 

For the fish largely possible that everything is as the beginning of the begining of time and is as the time of nonexistance.  

Possibly me and the dead fish are the same at the end.
