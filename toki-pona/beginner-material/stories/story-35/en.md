I heat water. 

I give the hot water to a small white container. 

I have a cloth container of many different red plants. 

The container has many tiny holes. 

I give the plant container to the hot water. 

The plant container reddens the hot water. 

I wait. I come to be located on a surface. 

My hands hold the hot red plant liquid. 

The land and house are cold. 

But my hands feel the good hot liquid.
