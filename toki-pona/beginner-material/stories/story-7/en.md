Many people are at the market. 

I need to buy a fish. 

"Buy a plant!" Someone says. 

I want a fish and no plant. 


"Buy a bird!" Someone else says. 

I want a fish, no plant and no bird.

"Buy sweet bread!" Someone else says. 

I see the bread. It is very visually good.

I want a fish and sweet bread, no plant and no bird.
