## Types

There are a few different types of texts. 
- Each [Theme](suli/) text is a collection of very short pages. Each page has five lines of text and a contextualizing picture. As the name suggests, these texts usually discuss various aspects of a single unifying theme. 
- [Bite-Sized](lili/) texts are short, simple, stand-alone narratives featuring one contextualizing picture. While none of them are over 200 words, some feature more advanced language. 

## Reading Tools

The reading experience is highly customizable. Each text has Toki Pona, Sitelen Pona, and English versions. There are four reading modes:

- In **Regular Mode**, texts are presented as they are. 
- In **Quiz Mode**, the contextualizing image is hidden and the ability to toggle English is turned off. 
- In **Line by Line Mode**, the English translation or latin alphabet transcription for individual lines can be revealed as needed, without needing to reveal the full text. 
- In **Table Mode**, directly compare English, toki pona, and sitelen pona lines. 

Additionally, each contextualizing image also comes with a contextualizing description and attribution. The visibility of these can toggled on and off as needed. 

## Notes on the English Translations

### Literal Translations

You may notice that some of the English translations appear to be ungrammatical, strange, or uncanny. This is because I've tried hard to reflect Toki Pona syntax and semantics in the English itself.

For example, I might translate something like, "I arrive in the large building's basement," **<span lang="tok">mi kama lon anpa pi tomo suli</span>**, as "I come to be located at the large building's underside." 

- **<span lang="tok">kama</span>**, used in this phrase as a preverb, is literally "come to be"
- **<span lang="tok">lon</span>**, used in this phrase as a preposition, is literally "located at"
- **<span lang="tok">anpa pi tomo suli</span>** is literally  "the large building's underside"

I hope this style of translation, while being slightly ungraceful, helps emphasize the language's unique structure and tendencies to learners.

### Multiple 'Right' Answers

My English translations offer *one* correct interpretation of the material, but *other correct interpretations are possible*.

For example, a **<span lang="tok">tomo suli</span>** can be a large structure, an important home, and old mansion, a large bus. 

When I translate a Toki Pona word, I am often forced to pick just one, specific, English word, even though the Toki Pona word is more broad. If you happen to think of a different word than the one I pick, it doesn't necessarily mean that you were wrong. 

For example, if your translation is **'big house'** and my translation is  **'old structure,'** and the picture is of a large, old mansion, **we are both right.** 

Consulting a [good dictionary](https://nimi.li) is one way to confirm your own interpretation, especially if you are just getting used to the words.
