## Types

There are a few different types of texts. 
- [Theme](suli/) texts are a collection of very short pages. Each page has five lines of text and a contextualizing picture. As the name suggests, these texts usually discuss various aspects of a single unifying theme. 
- [Bite-Sized](lili/) texts are short, simple, stand-alone narratives featuring one contextualizing picture. While none of them are over 200 words, some feature more advanced language. 

## Reading Tools

The reading experience is highly customizable. Each text has Toki Pona, Sitelen Pona, and English versions. There are four reading modes:

- In **Regular Mode**, texts are presented as they are. 
- In **Quiz Mode**, the contextualizing image is hidden and the ability to toggle English is turned off. 
- In **Line by Line Mode**, the English translation or latin alphabet transcription for individual lines can be revealed as needed, without needing to reveal the full text. 
- In **Table Mode**, directly compare English, toki pona, and sitelen pona lines. 

Additionally, each contextualizing image also comes with a contextualizing description and attribution. The visibility of these can toggled on and off as needed. 

## English Translations

You may notice that some of the English translations appear to be ungrammatical, strange, or uncanny. This is because I've tried hard to reflect Toki Pona syntax and semantics in the English itself.

For example, I might translate something like, "I arrive in the large building's basement," **<span lang="tok">mi kama lon anpa pi tomo suli</span>**, as "I come to be located at the large building's underside." 

- **<span lang="tok">kama</span>**, used in this phrase as a preverb, is literally "come to be"
- **<span lang="tok">lon</span>**, used in this phrase as a preposition, is literally "located at"
- **<span lang="tok">anpa pi tomo suli</span>** is literally  "the large building's underside"

I hope this style of translation, while being slightly ungraceful, helps emphasize the language's unique structure and tendencies to learners.

There are lots of Toki Pona words that have no English equivelant.  I am often forced to pick just one English word, even though the Toki Pona word is more broad. If some of my word choice puzzles you, having a [good dictionary](https://nimi.li) in a secondary tab is a good idea, especially if you are just getting used to the words.
