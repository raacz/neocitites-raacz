## Types

There are a few different types of texts. 
- Each [Theme](suli/) text is a collection of very short pages. Each page has five lines of text and a contextualizing picture. As the name suggests, these texts usually discuss various aspects of a single unifying theme. 
- [Bite-Sized](lili/) texts are short, simple, stand-alone narratives featuring one contextualizing picture. While none of them are over 250 words, some feature more advanced language. 
- [Quest](wawa/) texts consist of multiple pages that each span over 200 words, use more advanced language, and treat more technical subject matter. 

## Reading Tools

The reading experience is highly customizable. The Toki Pona texts are presented in the language's two writing systems: sitelen Lasina (the latin alphabet, which English also uses), and Sitelen Pona, where each word is represented by a single pictographic character. There are four reading modes:

- In **Regular Mode**, texts are presented as they are. 
- In **Quiz Mode**, the contextualizing image is hidden and the ability to toggle English is turned off. 
- In **Line by Line Mode**, the English translation or latin alphabet transcription for individual lines can be revealed as needed, without needing to reveal the full text. 
- In **Table Mode**, directly compare English, toki pona, and sitelen pona lines. 

Additionally, each contextualizing image also comes with a contextualizing description and attribution. The visibility of these can toggled on and off as needed.

Beginner Texts is designed with technical accessibility considerations in mind. 

The contexualizing descriptions are duplicated as alt text. If using a screenreader, you may prefer to turn either the contexualizing descriptions or the images off to prevent the presentation of duplicated information. These contextualizing descriptions contain all information that the story itself might reference.

## Notes


### About my English Translations

The English translations can be very helpful. But when you use them, it's good to be aware of the following things: 

<details markdown="1">
  
  <summary> <h4>Literal Translations</h4></summary>
  
  You may notice that some of the English translations appear to be ungrammatical, strange, or uncanny. This is because I've tried hard to reflect Toki Pona syntax and semantics in the English itself.
  
  For example, I might translate something like, "I arrive in the large building's basement," **<span lang="tok">mi kama lon anpa pi tomo suli</span>**, as "I come to be located at the large building's underside."
  
  - **<span lang="tok">kama</span>**, used in this phrase as a preverb, is literally "come to be"
  - **<span lang="tok">lon</span>**, used in this phrase as a preposition, is literally "located at"
  - **<span lang="tok">anpa pi tomo suli</span>** is literally  "the large building's underside"
  
  I hope this style of translation, while being slightly ungraceful, helps emphasize the language's unique structure and tendencies to learners.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
  <summary><h4>Multiple 'Right' Answers</h4></summary>
  
  My English translations offer *one* correct interpretation of the material, but *other correct interpretations are possible*.
  
  For example, a **<span lang="tok">tomo suli</span>** can be a large structure, an important home, and old mansion, a large bus.
  
  When I translate a Toki Pona word, I am often forced to pick just one, specific, English word, even though the Toki Pona word is more broad. If you happen to think of a different word than the one I pick, it doesn't necessarily mean that you were wrong.
  
  For example, if your translation is **'big house'** and my translation is  **'old structure,'** and the picture is of a large, old mansion, **we are both right.**
  
  Consulting a [good dictionary](https://nimi.li) is one way to confirm your own interpretation, especially if you are just getting used to the words.

tldr; try not to treat the English Translations too authoritatively.

  <summary>
    <h4>Non-Standard Words</h4>
  </summary>
  
  In the stories, I use the same words that I seriously use in real life.
  
  In <span lang="tok"><a href="https://linku.la/about?q=">lipu Linku</a></span> terms, relying on 2025 polling data, this means all **Core** words as well as the **Common** words: <span lang="tok">kipisi, kin, leko, meli, mije, misikeke, monsuta, n, namako, soko, tonsi</span>; and the **Uncommon** word: <span lang="tok">majuna</span>.

  You are free to use and not use whatever words you like. Most teachers recommend taking the time to really understand the **Core** words before experimenting with other words. See: "Can I add a new word?" at [/r/tokipona's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/wiki/faq/).

    <h4>Using Sitelen Pona</h4>
  </summary>

  All texts have both [Sitelen Pona](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_pona) and [sitelen Lasina](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_Lasina) versions. Each Sitelen Pona document is formatted separately; it is not simply a matter of applying a different font. There may be differences between the two versions. 

  

  I use a punctuation-less indented style of Sitelen Pona, and the site uses the <span lang="tok"><a href="https://github.com/etbcor/nasin-nanpa">nasin nanpa</a></span> font throughout.

  I regularly make use of the directional <span lang="tok">ni</span> to indicate <span lang="tok">e ni: </span>clauses.

    <h4>Grammatical Choices</h4>
  </summary>

  In this texts, I've decided to use some of these grammatical styles:

  Extensions:
  - extended <span lang="tok">li</span> style with <span lang="tok">mi</span> and <span lang="tok">sina</span>. 
  - multiple <span lang="tok">pi</span> phrases can be used subsequently (used only in Quest texts)
  - <span lang="tok">lukin</span> is used as a preverb meaning 'to try to' instead of <span lang="tok">alasa</span>

Restrictions:
  - <span lang="tok">kepeken</span> cannot be used as a content word
  - prepositional phrases cannot modify the subject
  - prepositional phrases cannot be used as transitive predicates
  - <span lang="tok">open</span> and <span lang="tok">pini</span> cannot be used as preverbs
