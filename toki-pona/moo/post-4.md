 When Sujale Tokipona Smith, the first true native toki pona speaker, came into the world, their mama jokingly declared them to be 'assigned tonsi at birth.'

It was just the two of them, mama and their partner, standing a good 30 ft out from shore in the freezing waters of the [REDACTED] free birthing it, and then, quite suddenly, 'they' transformed from two to three.

When jan Sujale was an infant, mama and their partner took it in turns to imbue the child with various languages. It was a rigorously scheduled time-table. From 0:00 to 06:00, mama spoke English and their partner spoke Mandarin. From 06:01 to 11:59, they both spoke toki pona. From 12:00 to 18:00, mama spoke Esperanto and their partner spoke Klingon. From 18:01 to 23:59, they both spoke toki pona. The system had been devised in order to position Sujale as appealing to other constructed language self-elected linguistic diasporas. While they both always denied it, mama and their partner had ambitious plans. Sponsored by a billionaire and so not needing to worry about plebian responsibilities such as working to support themselves, the two spent every waking moment contributing to Sujale's development, cultivating them, molding them. At 13 months old, Sujale muttered their first word at exactly 00:00. "Mama," they babbled. Taken off guard, mama went to their office and returned with a clipboard. After a second of hesitation, they notated the first entry into graphic organizer they had printed nearly a month before.
