oh, toki pona!

toki pona o!

maybe this is resistance.

i don't believe many would agree with me that this mode of expression, this way we move our lips and search for ideas past the event horizons cast by the shadows of esperanto, the way that a postcard flies to me from montreal addressed to a name of mine that certainly may exist, the tiny sighs of relief when we realize that We Are Here And Communicating To Each Other In This Moment!, the gibberish that my google nest mini cannot decipher or monetize; this is our resistance.

the way that we recoil into ourselves and write poetry that nobody, nobody else, not even our lovers, can understand or decipher or make use of. MAYBE these things that we whisper here, the muttering that we make when we stub our toes and cum on our hands in the dark MAYBE these are indications,

proliferations!

significations!

Sapir–Whorf chuckles as he stares down at me as I lay flowers at his tombstone.

I slap his face and spit in it, woof at a sapphic, horf a sapphire down, gulp, and SCREAM at this doubled anti-plural:

"YOU STUPID RICH WHITE MONOLINGUALS WILL NEVER CATCH ME NOW!"
