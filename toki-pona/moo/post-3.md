Dear Toki Pona,

WHY CANT YOU BE MORE THAN A QUIRKY PERSONALITY TRAIT WHY WONT YOU CAUSE ELECTRICAL SOCKETS TO EXPLODE WHEN WE CHANNEL POETRY THROUGH YOU WHY WONT YOU BE SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE AND SUBVERSIVE AND REVOLUTIONARY WHY WONT YOU SPIT OUT THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS THAT SHIT ALL OVER YOUR REPUTATION WHY WILL YOU NEVER SIGNAL BACK WHEN I SEND FLARES IN YOUR DIRECTION WHY ARE YOU ALL CRACKLE! AND POP! WITH NO SNAP! WHY DO YOU ONLY DARE TO POSSESS A SMALL HANDFUL OF US WHY DOES NEARLY EVERYONE SEEM TO WALK AWAY FROM YOU AFTER ONE-NIGHT STANDS WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN MY SHIP TO SERENADE WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO CRASH INTO THESE ROCKS WHY DO YOU WANT TO BRAID THE SEA-SOAKED HAIR OFF MY DEAD BODY INTO WIGS FOR YOUR FELLOW SISTERS WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?!

Best,

jan Lakuse
