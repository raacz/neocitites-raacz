there are small things in toki pona that reach out and brush you ever so often sentient sketchings from plato's cave playful pixies that decidingly do not reside in one's bone marrow, but in some ephereal plane that you can see into with a range of ten feet if you so happen to have the right tools equipped, you can see them dance a few paces to the right and then to the left before they flutter out of view and you're left gasping with the realization that money is just coloured time you hold close to your breast as white glittery unicorn spit surges up from your chest and onto the pavement with each strike the critics of Marx and Engels land square into your stomach. you throw your head back in a fit of laughter and scream out in delight as loud crickets pool at the corners of your mouth that things were always meant to be like this, except maybe we should be supporting teen moms with more daycare programming than we currently are.

for a second, you picture a lizard and know that it's not a fish.
