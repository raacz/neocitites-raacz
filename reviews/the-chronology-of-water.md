I will probably end up reviewing the entirety of Yuknavitch's oeuvre, since I've read most of it. With each new book that I read from her, I become more convinced that one has to read the totality of her works to get the full picture of things. I don't think you can read most of Yuknavitch's fiction without first reading this memoir. But I do think you can read this memoir alone.

Yuknavitch's life has been full of loss, of circular melancholia, of many kinds of water, of death, accompanied by a vast selection of colourful coping mechanisms. The subject range she manages to tackle is immense and she does it in such poetic language. She has so many stories, some painful, some sexy, some reckless, some that will make you despise her. They each come at you like waves crashing down on the shore. I read it all in one day.

I must admit that I read this memoir very consumptively. I felt like I was treating myself to a lovely pina coloda while lying on the beach while reading this. Lidia's misfortune stems from many unlucky circumstances, and many nameable persons. Her suffering, captured through flowing and evokative prose, is delightful to spectate. She doesn't implicate anyone outside of the text for the things that have happened to her, and she manages to perservere in the end. While there is heartache, there is also real joy. In this sense the narrative provides one with a sense of closure.

In Yuknavitch's fiction, she deploys many of the tropes of her life into paranormal artifacts of dystopian worlds, and this is where Yuknavitch gets messy and speculative. The Chronology of Water is the gateway into all of that, and it makes for a cozy, indulging, (and heartwrenching) read on a rainy day.
