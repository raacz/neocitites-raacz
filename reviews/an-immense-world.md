Everybody likes to be let in on a good secret. In this book, Yong interviews a series of animal experts and brings the reader along a journey that walks through the sensory experiences of our non-human kin- chemical senses such as smell and taste, mechanical senses such as hearing and sight, and a vast arrangement of other senses such as pain, temperature, magnetism sensing. To assume that the way that other animals experience the world in the same way that humans do would be very incorrect. The first step to empathizing with animals, Yong argues, is understanding how their way of interacting with the world or their Umwelten differ from a human's.

Maybe I shouldn't list this under 'monograph' because it's geared towards a popular audience. There are some instances where it has the same vibes as a self help book. Yong is a strong writer and has mastered the art of transitioning from one topic to another. The citation practices of this book are particularly innovative. I really enjoyed it. There's not much here that I can directly apply into my specialization really, but that made this read relaxing and leisurely.
