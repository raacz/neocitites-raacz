I wish I had read the first half of the book and then just stopped there. In fact, I would encourage you to do this, because the first half is absolutely stunning.

Bena and Sadhana's bond as sisters is strong due to the instability they've endured together through childhood. They lose their father. Then their mother. They join forces against the strict uncle that adopts them. But now they're no longer rebellious teenagers and now Sadhana is dead. Bena's son, Quinn, is growing more independent. And Bena has been tasked with the insurmountable task of cleaning out Sadhana's apartment.

I chose to read this book before embarking on a trip to Montreal, because I wanted to get a feel for the kind of place it was before I went there. There is little in this book about the topography of Montreal, but it is rich in it's discussion of what it means to parent. Everyone is a parent in this text. Sadhana mothers Quinn. Quinn fathers Bena. Bena mothers Libby. (Libby is an idiot). Bena mothers her uncle, her sister, her son and her mother. There is so much bitter familial love in this text. I would highly recommend just stopping once Libby and Ravi start becoming more prominent in the narrative, but if you choose to continue, be forewarned that it is way less immersive than the earlier parts of the book, and leaves a bad feeling in one's mouth.
