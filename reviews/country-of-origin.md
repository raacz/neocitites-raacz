Don Lee is primarily known for his short stories, and it shows. This novel is composed of a series of vignettes that all try to not be short stories, but they end up feeling like that anyway. It's a unique approach to write this part spy-novel, part murder-mystery, part-reunification story.

Lisa Countryman looks white, but she has not a speck of white in her. Her biological mother's yellow and her biological father's black have rendered Lisa a pale ghostly grey. She has returned to her birthplace of Japan as a young graduate student from Berkley researching Japanese hostess club culture. Lisa is revealed to have died in the first chapter, and the rest of the book follows Kenzo Ota, a sexless eccentric has-sensory-issues detective, and Tom, a half-asian half-white compulsively-lying military boy, as they trace Lisa's ghostly life and death through her old landlords, friends, clients, and enemies.

Although the book is set in Japan, it's really an exploration of what it means to be American when one's linguistic, racial, and passing status influence where one feels most at home. If you want to read to 'visit Japan,' this is not the book for you. Lee's portrayal of Japan often comes across as superficially as Lisa's preconceived notions of the place before she steps foot there. But this is the point. There is nothing familiar or homely in Don Lee's Japan. There is nothing welcoming there, because not one of the three narrating protagonists feel comfortable on Japanese (or American) soil.

I enjoyed collaging together Lisa's story through the various pieces that Lee throws out. I enjoyed this book precisely because all the characters are so unlikeable in such unique and charming ways. You can read this book while brain dead and you can read this book while completely activated.
