This intimate collection of creative nonfiction essays composed of a series of vignettes delineates mental illness in a place that rejects strictly pathological approaches and binary oppositions, and instead embraces aspects of literary craft and the confessional genre as its own kind of diagnostic procedure.

Elliott has had a life. She is a white-passing Haudenosaunee woman. She grew up poor. Her mother is bipolar. Her father has his own demons. She is a rape survivor. She is a mother. She has many, many stories. Through these essays, she seeks out the best way to tell them.

The section that was most useful to me (am I reading too extractively?) was a section about Margaret Atwood's comments on Canadian Literature, as well as the state of the canon more generally. Atwood renounces Pauline Johnson (who is a EXTREMELY respected Metis artist) as 'not the real deal,' writes Indigenous identities out of the canon, it's just really problematic things that she says. She then goes on to laud the work of Thomas King (who I have Some Opinions on that are potentially libelous) and it just makes it so clear to me how tough Indigenous writers have it, even through this wave of funding towards Indigenous literature that Canada is currently seeing. Elliott's comments also make me self-conscious about the review of The Marrow Thieves that can be found above. I've been taught to interact with IndigeLit as Indigenous Literature, and not just literature. There seems to be two different criteria that the academy teaches us to judge these two categories by, and the criterion is actually quite colonialist. I wonder where I can learn to do better. It's hard out here.
