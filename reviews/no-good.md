 That night, the town had seemed lit up just for her. But now she's hospitalized and will not speak and the reader is left with fragments to piece together the full story; what led an up-and-coming interior design Wunderkind to abandon yellow bikinis and make an attempt on her life?

This story is subtle, gentle and treads carefully around its main focus: white fragility. Ironically, it's white voices that have generally dominated conversations about White Fragility (see Robin DiAngelo) so I was pleasantly surprised to just happen to stumble upon a piece written by a POC that depicted it so playfully. One can read this piece as a satire, though I'm not sure if the average white person would be able to easily detect that reading. And perhaps that is the point, it's thinly disguised by all the markers that white literature usually employs when portraiting a sympathetic young lady in mental anguish, but these devices leak irony as more background is slowly revealed over the course of the narrative. It's a clever piece and I liked it a lot.
