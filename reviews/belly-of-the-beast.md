This book is less than a hundred pages long, so maybe instead of listening to what I have to say about it, go and read it yourself?

What does it mean to be Black and Fat? What dance of signifieds swirl around the Black Fat body, police it, perceive it, love it, murder it?

This book addresses predominant abolitionist imaginations and says 'you're not imagining hard enough.' Sometimes, I felt uncomfortable reading this book. It calls you out. It forces you into the conversation, and this is good. But while the content is sometimes provocative and challenging and forces you to step outside of your comfort zone, it remains close, intimate and cozy throughout. The narrative voice verges on being hypnotic for me. It also has tremendous re-read value. This book will be one that I return to again and again for the rest of my life.
