Lizards in the house means money would soon enter the home. Mandy lives in a shed with her mother and two brothers. The land is barren and drought-stricken so she has become a lizard, a pest that must be tolerated, a being who is designed to live in waterless conditions. But she is also a ten year old girl and has a friend of the same age who lives next door, a friend who wants to catch a glimpse of her form as she bathes in the middle of the night using the only water available-- the landlord's hose.

I read this story as a commentary on the model minority myth. For every succesful rich Asian that you see, there are a dozen others who are barely scraping by. The whole idea of a 'poor Asian' is seen in society as a contradiction, yet it is reality for the vast majority. Lizard Luck manages to articulate one possible experience of growing up as this contradiction, while the state looms over everyone and is the only grace by which the moon is allowed to shine each night.

I love K-Ming Chang's blending of various word classes. I personally read this story as allegory but it could equally by taken in as magic realism. It's a short read but the metaphors are all really visceral. I read it just a moment ago, so I think I will have to let it marinate in my head for a little bit.
