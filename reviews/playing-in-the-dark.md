In this monograph, Morrison proposes a reanalysis of the American literary tradition, characterizing it as wielding a particular kind of freedom: the freedom to excercise total control over the bodies and lives of Black enslaved peoples. Her argument walks through a handful of classic white American texts in which she studies how these writers construct an Africanist prescence, whose docility, lack of agency and powerlessness is always a reflection of white anxieties over the founding of a new precarious nation. She very convincingly suggests that the lack of attention paid to these Africanist characters have resulted in misreadings by white literary critics who attempt to treat these 'canonical texts' as post-racial.

This is my first time delving into Toni Morrison's critical texts. I am more accustomed to recognizing her as a famous creative writer. Recently I've been exploring alternative ways to approach literary criticism, and Morrison does a bit of that here. She explicitly attributes the formation of the ideas in her book to her acquired ability to read texts through the perspective of a writer. By imagining what it would be like to write the texts that she studies, she is able to gain new understanding from them.

I really like this framework. I can sometimes see my Critical Race studies professor engage with texts in this way and it is a radically different approach from how the academy trains us traditionally. I feel ashamed that I haven't read any literary texts from Morrison herself, and I really want to now that I know some of her theory.
