Vivek Oji has left behind a cousin, a grieving mother, a distant father, and a circle of friends who have collectively decided to keep Vivek's secrets to themselves. The story is an account of biological family, of chosen family, of identity and mental health and culminates by answering a question: Why did Vivek die?

I'm amazed at how Emezi is able to firmly establish the novel in Nigeria without ever performing autoethnography. Foreign words are left untranslated. Caste issues are never explained. Even food is never really described. We're simply in Nigeria, and there's no tour guide to here to tell me what all this stuff means.

This is a book about lgbt+ issues. It's a celebration of trans bravery and of queer communities. It's tragic, yes, but it's tragic in a very hopeful way. There's this trope where queer and trans characters never get any happy endings, and Emezi is aware of this and fights back. The one issue I have with this book is it's predictability. The speaker keeps trying to dangle a carrot over the reader to tempt them into treating the book as a mystery novel. The mystery elements of this story aren't its strength. I actually think it could have been a stronger book if some of the 'mystery' elements had been revealed sooner.

The true success of this book is that it paints a hopeful picture for lgbt+ rights in Nigeria. I recently did a report on a book that features two star-crossed gay lovers in Haiti, and the author admitted in an interview that it was difficult to write them as anything other than tragic due to the current state of lgbt+ rights in that country. It just shows that I need to read more queer/trans Black lit that are written BY queer/trans Black authors before I let these books by straight cis authors form my impression of the world.
