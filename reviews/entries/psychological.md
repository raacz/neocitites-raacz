I read Vol.4 and Vol.5 from Nisio Isin's Zaregoto series. I actually skipped over the third volume because I was cringing too much, but I have read Vol.2 and I've watched the adaptation of Vol.1. If you know me primarily over Discord, you may be familiar with my profile picture. That profile picture comes from this Zaregoto series, the blue haired girl is called Kunagisa Tomo and she is a neurodivergent computer genius.

I don't want to waste too much time writing a review on this. I like Nisioisin's stuff for how it refuses to conform to expected genre expectations. I really find it difficult to appreciate the work when it is so flagrant and objectifying towards its female characters. The protagonist is a nihilist and despite the plot screwing him over, the book always ends up affirming the protagonist's world view. This is a general trend for books in the Zaregoto series, not just in these two volumes. This work in particular makes some real odd assertions about the nature of concepts such as 'intelligence' 'genius' and 'talent' and how society should be structured around those who are 'naturally' blessed with these characteristics. It seems to suggest that those with 'lower' intellect should just play along with the system, because things will eventually work out in the end.

I've continued to read this series because despite how much I disagree with the messaging of the work, the execution is delightful. It's so entertaining. Mixing together high-brow and low-brow writing styles, the resulting product is chaotic and hard to put down. The book will tell you right at the start that the mystery is pointless and the intruige is all a sham, and you are loped into getting invested in it anyway. I love it as much as I despise it, and I've already downloaded Vol.6 onto my phone.
