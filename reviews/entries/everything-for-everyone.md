This is a collaboratively written series of interviews written from a future in which, after ecological and political collapse, communism has emerged as the stabilizing force that connects people and provides for them. It is a really beautiful collection of stories. It's not utopian fiction, as there is quite a lot of work yet to be done in order for everyone to truly have everything. But it's a piece that gives me a lot of hope, regardless.

Everything for Everyone features the fictionalized future versions of the authors going about NYC and conducting a series of interviews in an effort to reconstruct a people's history of the revolution as it happened, and to record the current ways of life and identify point of improvement. While dressed up in a very academic-sounding title, the book isn't really academic in tone. One of the key contentions that the authors face is the idea that, in a communist world, the institutions of knowledge production would be bottom-up instead of top-down. The academy is abolished, but the authors have to work past the academic training they have in order to write an oral history that is accessible to everyone. But besides that meta-narrative, the subjects they interview are incredibly diverse. You also don't have to read the whole book in order to gain something from it, as the chapters can each stand on their own. Some of my favourite chapters include the penultimate chapter interviewing Kayla Puan, a trans youth. The chapter shows family abolition in action, which I love. Another favourite is the interview of Latif Timbers, who is a gestation worker. The book really tears apart the position of women as givers of birth and homemakers. It's important to note that in this text, science can has lead to the point where everyone the ability to give birth, regardless of whether you were born with a penis or vulva or otherwise. The chapter on gestation really explores how the act of giving birth, when democratized, can be a really liberating (instead of oppresive) act.

I could nitpick about how I think some of the ways of living presented in this book may not be realistic, or how the book doesn't give disabled people ample representation, or how its writing style is occasionally unconvincing, and how the imagined slang of the future is sometimes more distracting than immersive. But in truth, I just really love this book. It's not a perfect book, but it really gives me a lot of hope. Stories and fiction engage with liberation theory in a different way than theory alone can. The premise is really great and lends itself extremely well towards the collaborative writing process. After I finished this, I leaned back and craved more. I want to read other thinkers engage with a similar premise, so if anyone has recommendations, let me know!
