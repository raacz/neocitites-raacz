The unanimous / Mother / when / does she arrive?

I feel like this book-length poem is to be read aloud by a menstruating person during a solar eclipse. Or maybe this is to be read at a child's birth. It is a poem about birth, about creation. But it's not just the amniotic, contrapuntal birth of human life. It's about the birth of ideas, about the birth of time. It takes place outside, while looking up as the stars are erased by approaching orange daylight.

And Those Ashen Heaps That Cantilevered Vase Of Moonlight is not a book. It is an experience. It is something you have to hold in your hands and be able to smell as you read it aloud, your mouth ripening with filthy words and sharp fricatives and calls for mercy. My only complaint is that no library in Canada holds it, so I had to ordeal in order to obtain it.

Again, it's an experience, not a book. So your experience will differ from mine. I hope one day I can meet another person that experiences comraderie with this book. I hope we can hold hands during a misty twilight and talk about our ancestors together.
