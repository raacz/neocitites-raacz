This novel shines an unforgiving light at the refugee crisis.

In high school, my literature class was made to read a story about a crew getting stranded at sea, eventually drawing lots to eat each other. I've been somewhat afraid of boats ever since and this novel by El Akkad only strengthens my utter fear. El Akkad constructs the boat like a horror writer writes an abandoned school. I got so uncomfortable while reading this book, I became so unnerved by the cruelty of this world. The cunning survival of innocent childhood is dashed by the horrible games that the adults play. There are very few characters that love in this book.

I wish I could cry as I read What Strange Paradise, but I couldn't. The root of all of this is cold, stalwark and apathetic bureaucracy. One is left feeling helpless and treading for water in a pool of poetic images; Umm Ibrahim's surprise, Amir's stubborness, return to the womb.
