I had high expectations for this book and they didn't quite deliver. Cultural appropriation is a really delicate issue and while Rekdal was able to pull out a whole bunch of granular examples of cultural appropriation in practice, I feel like she didn't address enough of her book to fellow BIPOC, who are the people who should be discussing this issue. Instead, it's approach that positions itself as palatable to a more 'general writerly demographic' holds it back from diving into the meat of the matter, and from saying something that hasn't already been said before.

Rekdal's book is set up as a set of letters addressed to a white graduate member of one of her writing workshops. I wonder how the book would have ended up if similar material was presented in a different format.

Alisha Elliott's essay on cultural appropriation, found in her essay collection 'A Mind Spread Out on the Ground' is shorter and more innovative, and part of its success is due to Alisha's ability to fully engage with her identity as a white-passing Haudenosaunee woman. Rekdal, despite being BIPOC, doesn't seem to work her experiences of being biracial and Asian into her analysis.
