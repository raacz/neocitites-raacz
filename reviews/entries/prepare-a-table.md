Candace is a well-reputed server at a very fancy, high-end restaurant. The restaurant's "scandalous" main dish, who's price remains formally unlisted on the menu, is cappricio. It's an italian appetizer dish made up of raw cuts of very thinly sliced meat, and the restaurant serves only the finest cuts from the thighs of Candace and her fellow waitresses.

This work is mainly a feminist critique, and though it does hint at class-based ideas, it steers clear from deconstructions of gender and of race-based issues. It's a short story, it can't really be helped, and it's offers a solid starting point to bounce ideas off of, but alone the text is more of a impotus for thought rather than a conclusive one. It identifies problems and doesn't offer solutions, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The writing style maximizes the shock value of the premise, and the story is best read going in completely blind. I can't help but think that the story doesn't go far enough considering how intent it is on making you feel uncomfortable, and considering the web journal that published it which tends towards the radical and the experimental.
