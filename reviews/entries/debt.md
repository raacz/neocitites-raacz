Money confounds me. As a person with very strong financial anxiety, and very little knowledge about economics, it is very difficult for me to talk myself down from the ledge if I start panicking because money is difficult to imagine in concrete terms. Reading this book is a bit therapeutic, and Graeber's execution here is absolutely incredible. How does debt arise as a human construct? How are debt and capitalism intertwined and how can they be separated? How do economists justify the cruelty of debt peonage as 'natural?'

He approaches the history of debt as a person with a background in religion and culture and the resulting product will make you see everything in a different light. I emphasize especially with the frameworks that he employs and his repurposing of very emotionally charged words such as 'communism' and 'love.' So much of this talk is head-based, but Graeber aims to speak to the heart. As a linguistics nerd, I especially enjoyed how he examined debt from the position of how the concept is employed in folk idioms across place and time. This work is especially valuable to me as I learn more in school about social enterprises and other projects of wealth redistribution that operate simultaneously within the bounds of and on the fringes of capitalist machinery.

Money still confounds me and I still have very strong financial anxiety. But now I can imagine it all coming down with a little more ease, and if that is something you are also working on, I'd give this book a go.
