This is a YA selection that was recommended to me by a professor who touted it as a "damning critique of the Canadian state." She brought it up as a counterpoint to what she was describing to me as settler post-apocolyptic fiction, a theorized genre that erases Indigenous people after apocolypse and operates to recreate colonial values in the rebuilding of society after the destruction of it all. The Marrow Thieves is a celebration of Indigenous survival in an apocolyptic scenario that wavers scarily close to our current timeline, in a world ravaged by the natural conclusion of the capitalistic settler-colonial prison complex.

Frenchie is a Metis youth just trying to survive in a world that want to eat him-literally. The government is hunting down Indigenous people and sending them to 'schools,' a euphemistic term for harvesting factories. It's a holocaust scenario and one person cannot brave it alone. Frenchie meets a group of fellow survivors. Together they become acquainted again with the old Indigenous ways of being as they forge a new life and a new family off the grid and on the run. The action is harrowing and one is always expecting trouble around the corner. It's hard for the group to get settled, but they find new comfort in the uncomfortable.

I had a brief discussion with my professor where we centered on one premise that the text holds. The world of Marrow Thieves can empirically test for whether a person is Indigenous or not. This is a fantasy. In reality, Indigenous identity is a strategic social construct and who counts as 'Indigenous' is constantly in flux. Nowadays, there is a reckoning happening within the community as many so-called 'Indigenous' cultural icons, scholars and community members have been revealed to have misrepresented their culture background-- they have fabricated Indigenous heritage. It's a very contentious issue within the community itself because colonialism has mechanisms in place that actually erase people's Indigenous heritage. Colonialism does not want Indigenous people to exist. Due to this, when people are accused of 'Pretendianism' and asked to provide some 'proof' they actually can't. Canada has destroyed that proof. On the other hand, the threat that these 'Pretendians' pose is quite real. By claiming scholarly spots, publishing deals and limelight under the pretense of being Indigenous, they are robbing actually marginalized Indigenous community members of these opportunities and further weakening policies that strive to redistribute wealth equally among these disenfranchised communities. White people steal Indigenous stories like they steal land. If you're still reading this, I probably don't have to explain why this is bad.

Regardless this book is majorly important for how it shows Indigenous people using Indigenous methods to heal and survive against a colonial threat that wants to murder all of them. And it's directed at young people. When I was younger, I retreated into dystopian worlds like Hunger Games and Divergent because I felt, like Katniss or Tris, that the odds were completely stacked against me and I needed to be brave. I can't imagine how inspiring this book could be to an Indigenous kid growing up in 2022 as Canada continues its project to try to "kill the Ind*an in the child."
