 This piece strikes a particular chord in me. It sort of encapsulates that feeling of knowing you're different but being totally unaware of why, the sacrifices that our predecessors made and the things they don't talk about anymore.

Stacey's grandmother makes four extended trips from China to visit her daughter's family in America. While initially adoring her wild antics and unconventional style, Stacey slowly develops this seething ambivalence towards her grandmother as she grows up and stops being at that age where one easily embraces 'playing pretend.' What explanation is there for her grandmother's behaviour? [Read it here](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-28/fiction-drama/why-were-they-throwing-bricks/).

I mentioned this somewhere up there but I'm slowly grappling my head over the notion of BIPOC writers as being those who write not for their kin but to their kin. I remember attending a play for my first year theatre class. It was a play about the Chinese/Canadian diaspora and it was a multimedia production, very experimental. I really did feel like the play was written to me. During the class discussion, I learned that the rest of my class didn't really appreciate it. They thought it was boring. To me, it was revolutionary. I left the theatre reeling. My mind felt like it was falling apart in the best way possible. But I didn't speak up in the class discussion of the play. I didn't want to 'perform' my Otherness like that, in a class where I was the only Chinese person. At the time, I didn't know why I fell silent, but now I do. And that's why, now, I'm not going to tell you exactly what this short story made me feel.

It struck a chord. It brought up memories. It made me grieve. That's all you get to know.
