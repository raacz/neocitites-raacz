"There's not enough for next week."

Under the crusts of my nails swells

Cloud of you and yours, dear, it is

And it isn't how we first thought

When we toasted to love and life

On the boarding platform in July

Little tracks clamped over limbs

Restrict my twirling and my whirling

I pomegranate propositional projectiles

Ceasefire over your mountainous

This mountain belongs to Them not us

We've been planning to hike it but

Procrastinations craft citrus-fragrant

Continuities to sniff between rusty

Partitions that we positioned for tomorrow

Yesterday. I went to the refrigerator

I tried to measure how much juice

We drank last week. I can't seem to

Number these distances, please help.

These are the visions that are anding me.

But and but, but and but, but,

I want to hike the mountain alone

And I can't get out of my bed.
