This is just a small note to provide clarification, if one wishes to know. 

## Is It Your Book?

No, I am not an author of this book. I clarify this because the original edition and listing of the book indicated me an author, and implied my endorsement. I don't endorse this book, I don't quite know what's in the final version, and I did not play a part in its initial publication. 

However, the book does feature an adaption of some of my work. 

## My 'Section' Within the Book

The book features an adaptation of my work: Sonja Lang took a transcript of [an episode I did for kalama sin](https://wikisource.org/wiki/Kalama_sin/8), edited it slightly and presented it in Sitelen Pona. 

This is a legal use of my work, which was licensed under CC-BY-SA. The vast majority of my work is licensed like this, and can be used for commercial purposes, given that it doesn't imply my endorsement. While initially the book's cover and marketing did imply my endorsement, once I notified the author of this misstep, Sonja Lang took quick action to correct this. 

I cannot speak to whether the edited version is any better than my original version. 

But, inspired by this new revival of a very old work of mine, I decided to release [my own updated version](../post-5). 

This new version transforms the ideas of the podcast episode to a narrative style more suitable to the reading medium, updates it to fit my current toki pona style, and is generally more clear than the original. 

It also makes some very experimental use of sitelen pona. 

Of course, the original version was fine as well. I simply was inspired to remake it in the spirit of creativity and empowerment.
