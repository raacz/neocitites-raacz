I was initially going to write this on December 31, but the day escaped me.

## 2025 in Retrospect

It's been a year. 

**Despite becoming professionally certified,** my ambitions for a career in digital accessibility fell through after I gave my first a11y workshop in June. I've collected all the fragmented pieces of hubris and stashed them in a junk drawer. I will revisit them, reexamine them, rebuild them, reform them, later.

Part of the fallout from this has been picking up more part-time work. I've now been employed for a full year with the school. I picked up even more hours in September, and even more in December. **Now we're at five hours per day.**

I like this life. 
- **Being paid for work I do is great.** If my job did continue through the summer, it would be enough money to *just* scrape by if I wanted to move out and live in a bedroom in a shared house. But it doesn't continue through the summer, and that hypothetical is just wall etchings carved by something outside of myself. I live with my parents now, and the pay is more than enough. It's abundance.  
- **I have lots of room for Toki Pona**, and lots of room for other little goosechases that come seeking me out. I have my evenings completely open, meaning I can make all of my taiko commitments.  
- **It forces me to touch grass and move my body.** I walk tons (yesterday my step count was 23k). I wake up early. I get a lot of fresh air. 

I will miss this life when summer 2026 comes, and then autumn arrives. I will likely enroll in school again and then things will shift again, dramatically, likely for the worse.

**But just so that Future Me doesn't get too nostalgic about this time of my life:**
- Many of the students are mean and aggressive and enjoy when I get frustrated. 
- My labour is functionally unnecessary yet extremely stressful, and between students and other staff members, I am not respected by anyone, with the exception of three people (J, S, and L). 
- When I do have an impact on student's lives, that impact is almost always inevitably negative. It's not my fault, it's due to how my job relates to other systems in place within the school. I am only empowered to give thorns, not roses. The small roses I do try to offer are actual contrary to the existential intent of the job. 

I did quite a lot of stuff with my free time. Lots of it was same as last year, but some things stood out as new experiences. 

- **Started to become a lot more comfortable with technology.** Eleventy has been a playground where I can experiment with so many weird and interesting things. Within my experimentations, LLMs serve to scaffold my learning of programming in ways that were previously not possible. 
- **Participated in NASK and the DLK, building on my Esperanto and meeting new friends.** And was able to do so with lots of financial support from KEA, I am ever grateful. 



**And of course, the most important new thing in my life; in August 2025, I finally got diagnosed and medicated.** I get emotional even just thinking about it. It was a long time coming. Getting medicated was even more game-changing then I imagined it could be. My mental health has improved significantly, many dormant passions have been reignited. I am able to actually do things that I want to do, and not just dream despairingly, 'O, would I were a different person other than myself!'

### Toki Pona Round-Up

With lots of free time, comes lots of Toki Pona. I've broken this section into my teaching activities (written in English), and my creative outputs (written in TP).

#### Teaching

Through 2025, I've continued to teach with a third party website for payment. This year, I also taught a select few indivuals on a volunteer basis. 


**In March, I set up a weekly ongoing 'LPSL club', which continues to now.** I've tried to set up weekly meetings before, but things haven't stuck until now. Discord's new Events tab was crucial to making this work. I no longer have to do my own announcements and pings and cross-timezone scheduling. I simply get out of bed and teach because the calendar says that I'm teaching today. 

**In total, I taught 222 lessons in 2025, for a combined 222 hours.** (This was a massive jump up from 2024, where the numbers were 52 hours for 59 lessons.) These figures break down into:
- 72h teaching Toki Pona for payment (105 lessons)
- 20h teaching Toki Pona as a volunteer (18 lessons)
- 66h teaching LPSL publically (45 lessons)
- 54h teaching LPSL privately (54 Lessons) 


There are two students who I think progressed the most under my tutelage. Both of them were very consistent; one of them was paying me and learning Toki Pona, the other one was learning LPSL. 

**My primary LPSL student and I met on an almost-weekly basis.** While we started off slow, I can basically now sign at full speed with them and they pick up on nearly everything. It's been incredible, and I feel really proud of them and also it's very reassuring for me. I've done a lot of teaching of LPSL. In group lessons, its hard to give tailoured feedback and to give the intermediate signers more space to practice expression. The one-on-one medium fixes all those problems and ends up being extroardinarily fruitful. I'm very, very proud of my student and I treasure the close friendship our tutoring sessions has cultivated. Very excited to see them progress even further!

### Summarized

Lots of art, increased amount of work, lots of art+work, lots of lessons learned. I really enjoyed 2025, despite some of its more unsavoury moments. I'm very grateful for the life I have. It's a position of privilege and I hope I never forget that. 

## 2026 Look-Ahead

There are various things I want to work on this year. In general, I want my life to be more **wholesome.**

### Habit-wise

I want to get better about my phone addiction and I want to read more. I will know I've reached my goal when the thing I reach for when I'm bored is my Kobo, and not my phone. 

I also want to stop purchasing crap from TEMU. 

### Attitude-wise 

This past year, my focus and attention has been on production and being productive. This year, I want to balance that drive and recognize when my determination is becoming too single-minded, and self-absorbed. I want to frequently check in with the overall health of the forest instead of only addressing individual trees. 

### Work-wise

As of right now, it is my plan to spend the next couple of years [becoming an ASL interpreter](/blog/asl/asl-log/). The program starts in September. In the meantime, I want to rework my relationship with the language. I want to drop my ego, I want to focus mostly on building reception skills.
