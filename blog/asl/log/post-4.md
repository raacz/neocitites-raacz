#### Notes

- Tornado i  like Twirl, t the fingers move together, and the NMM is different. It has an alternate with an inversed A-hand
- One version of ballet is like twirl, but moves up and down. A lower context version is Dance+Twirl-upwards. The same sign can mean smoothie

- God, strawberry has so many versions. I was kinda desperate to find what the Manitoba version was so I found this [Eat Your Colours](https://youtu.be/YmVJLaD4Pow?t=59).

- sign glossed as 'prepare' looks like plan
- revoked/expired license can be signed as license + one L moving down
- note this gloss: get license same teacher of deaf, could be an SEEism, unsure.
