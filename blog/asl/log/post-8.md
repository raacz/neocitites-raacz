More, still more. Later, flowers for the bees, until they think that warm days shall never cease, for summer has o'er brimm'd their clammy cells. 

I think I was avoiding doing this. Unsure, actually. It's hard to muster up a lot of gumption when I've classified this period of time as a 'holiday' in my head. I might have to take off to a fast food establishment tomorrow so that I can focus. 

Went through a bunch of reels just... looking at them. Still not at the point where I can dissect unsubtitled content in here, but I do feel less anxious looking at it then I did when I started. I accidentally read the fingerspelling for Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas. And that was kinda shocking. 

### First Video

[My Online Client, Marc]() by Rob O'Mahoney

#### Notes
- transcript: my on+line [] #marc look-like ix-image-on-screen approach-me request help-him change ix-poss body, change ix-poss life #style. i say i can lead ix #as long he put commitment, keep++, hard work in, [] together [shows different photos from different weeks] see how work hard team keep link together. 
- I can't find other attestation for the sign that is translated as 'commitment'. It looks just like cookie. I think it's an SEE sign. In other videos, Rob does sign very SEE. Well... good to know!


### Second Video

[I cannot believe what I've read]() by Sandro Hatibovic

This one was hilarious! 

#### Notes
- transcript: omg i read++ ix-on-cl-book #LAW say person allow enter(inflected) your house without your permission or clueless-you. ix what-do take+++ food finish drink good. one fine-fine give. leave! who?? santa. wow(mouthed).
- clueless is done with the dominant hand while the nondominant hand points out at you, as if to mock you. 
- so this is a piece that is heavily exaggerated for comedic effect. The finish was pretty inflected, and the sign for 'person' was maybe an international one? 


### Third Video

[What was it like after the divorce?]() by Irina Burke

#### Notes
- I've never seen WITH inflected like that before. Wow. That's powerful.
- 'move-on' is an interesting one. I crossreferenced with handspeak, and it's not there. But it's the MOVE handshape signed a little like KEEP.
- heart-shattered... aaa
- in 'what could i possibly say to my children', i believe she's signing 'say children how', with a very inflected how. 
- 'true-biz finish work?' is translated to 'is it really over?'
- spent a minute trying to figure out the gloss for what is translated to 'how will i cope with this alone?' What's going on here, I think (insert large caveat here) she does '#COPE manage/control alone' with A hands instead of X hands. Which makes sense. They're pretty close.

- Challenging
