It's christmas day and I'm at family's and bored. So let's watch some FB Reels. 

### First Video

[There are many different holiday traditions around the world]() by Marjorie Charles Sonnenstrahl

#### Notes
- leaning PSE here 
- traditions initialized 

#### Vocab
- Tradition

### Second Video

[Metro in CDMX is cheap!]() by Marcelino Sanders

#### Notes
- impress, is it an A-palm facing out against a flat hand (like YT), the unit moved backwards?
- ix-own card metro you can go any+where in mexico city region for what_rhet five dollars [] flat #rate. mean what_rhet you can go far include transfers same cost five dollars, nothing increased, same flat, near far no-matter. compare japan and thailand nearby lessened cost far-away go-far increased(using bigger handshape) cost depend where you go. cost you when leave exit. happen here mexico [] cost you when enter five dollars flat #rate wow-cool, meaning save money not [] (like tossing money out there) can go any where!
- COST used as a transitive verb for 'to charge someone' 
- bigger-increase shown with the sign down with B hands instead of Us. 
- interesting way that far was deployed twice to emphasize that something was far, and that someone was going far. 

#### Vocab
- Metro
- Mexico
- Transfer (public transport)
- Flat
- Cost

### Third Video

- 'Plan' is used as 'planner' 
- this business variation is interesting
- the mouthings on limited and supply is also quite interesting
- curious to find out the tie-up-know sign used to indicate like 'shops wrapped up' 
- fingerspelled 'the' !!
