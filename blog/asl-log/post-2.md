### First Video

By Atomic Hands on FB Reels, [Halloween Balloon Experiment](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1849562302298005)

#### Notes
- Note that the signer does experiment's initialisation a claw.
- 'Some' conceptually translated as 'other' 
- 'Pour' as in 'pour just a little bit' uses G for smallness
- Baking Soda is fingerspelled here
- MELON AND SPIRIT + mouthings and context = PUMPKIN AND GHOST
- Chemical reaction, signed as Chemistry + some kind of two pointers crossing as in a intersection. PO self. 
- CO2 signed as CO + the hand lowers to sign 2 (PO out, not self, oddly)
- Penultimate sentence has a thing like see-good? Can't identify it

#### Vocab
- Balloon
- Experiment
- Cup (Measurement)
- Vinegar
- Tablespoon
- Melon

### Second Video

By Deafpoetrylovers on FB Reels, [One-Word Collaborative Poetry](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1570398451053896)

#### Notes
- Well-known signed as #well+KNOW
- Compile/Distill is conceptualized as ABBREVIATE
- Kindness conceptualized as Heart Touch + Progress?? No. It's just a two part sign. 
- Never seen this version of flexible, but it does kinda look like 'weak' and the more general flexible has a baby?
- This version of 'film' also is a [mix of the two variations presented on Handspeak](https://www.handspeak.com/word/3021/)
- 'Performance' here is also something that I've never seen before. It kinda looks like it combines several other concepts to convey a certain kind of awe? Unsure if those are eyes watching?
- Fascinating. The artist who compiles all of these signs into a narrative form opts to use more traditional forms of 'Performance' and 'Film.' She also changes the initialized VALUE to CHERISH.
- HA! I totally missed the note in the bottom that says 'You may see them using different sign languages because they come from different countries.' Well, good to know that flexible, film, and performance are likely not signed that way in ASL



#### Vocab
- Poetry
- Kindness
- Value 
- Inspiration

### Third Video

By Deaf LEAD on FB Reels, [Domestic Violence Awareness Month](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1096908535851820)

#### Notes
- Domestic Violence is abbreviated to DV
- Emotions signed here with palms oriented to each other. 
- Survivor signed as LIFE+AGENT
- 0:26 has a sign that maps onto 'grow', or 'increase,' or 'build-up'. Two U hands tapped a little bit like chair, moving upwards. 
- The same signer signs 'cause' as something that looks like 'EXPRESS' to me. Looks like I didn't know CAUSE before. I expected it to look something like because. Toki Pona brain. 
- 'Let's break' as in 'let's break the silence' as push down, relegate.
- 24/7 signed as 24 SLASH 7. Slash is a B mimicking the slash down. 


#### Vocab
- Anxiety
- Trauma
- Deserve

### Interlude

I watched way more than three videos. The session went for about an hour, ready to take a break now.
