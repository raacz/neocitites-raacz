Today we're going to go through some content from Vicars.

Earlier today, I watched a couple of videos on FB Reels. 

Two that stick out were both from Atomic Hands. 

### First Video

[The Hubble Telescope](https://www.facebook.com/atomichands/videos/1514823059733080)


#### Notes:
- Conceptualizing the ideas of East Coast-West Coast America. 
- Note the different sign used for 'takes pictures of' since it's a satelite (flat O)
- This signer emphasizes STILL by signing it downwards rapidly.

#### Vocab
- Telescope
- Space
- Galaxy


### Second Video

[Fingerprints](https://www.facebook.com/atomichands/videos/1514823059733080)

#### Notes:
- MATCH as in the interlocking one, used to indicate that an almost exact matchp
- Lots of ways the signer suggests ideas about grip and friction

#### Vocab
- Fingerprints
- Identical
- Human
- Sweat

### First Lecture

I figured I would do some Vicars today. Starting off with [St. Patrick's Day (ASL vocabulary)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P8iNyDejsI), posted 9 months ago. 

#### Notes
- Lettuce in context: Cabbage
- Beef can be fingerspelled
- Feast: lots of moku
- movement often reduces for compounds. 
- International sign for ireland has a variation where it's like a harp being played
- australia old sign used to look like ireland
- kidnap/seize, signed with a full grabbing S-hand, while the V-hand can also be used for recuiting. trafficking puts this idea underground (a nondominant flat hand)
- the leprechaun sign is like big elf ears, can actually conflict with the concept of 'elf', in which case an initialized version of 'Angel' can be used.  
- "Good luck" could be signed with the signed for 'lucky' but it's more idiomatic to fingespell luck with the same gusto that you would sign initialized BACK.  
- March fingerspelled gets a mutated c-h, and sometimes the m is also mutated. 
- Pirate is also the sign for 'raiders' 
- can do rainbow one-handed by glistening the five-hand a bit. 
- signing a 'pot of gold,' you should indicate that the pot is full of something (lest you imply that it's a pot made out of gold)
- Rebel is upright, resist, is more like pushing something that's directly in front of you (pushing on you, even)

### Third Video

By MJ Grant on FB Reels, [Who doesn't love to wake-up happy?](https://www.facebook.com/reel/852535347482567)

Really need to get better at one-handed signing reception. I'm very bad at it. 

#### Notes
- Her 'emabrassed' looks a lot like LPSL kulupu- not as much up and down/at and angle as what Joanna's [Embarassed on Handspeak](https://www.handspeak.com/word/660/). 
- In the sentence, '#TAYLOR SWIFT SING+agent IX ME FAN ME LOVE #HER', the 'her' really sneaks up on you. Why fingerspell in this moment? Curious behind the grammatical reasons. 
- One handed CHAMP...
- Unsure how the R-hand thrusted to show a promise, mouthing 'Best Friends' is glossed.
- Ok so in another sentence, MJ does 'AND #SHE SIGNING". I think the fingerspelled pronoun is a form of emphasis!

    <p>
      Fingerspelling for emphasis can also be used in casual conversation for dramatic effect.…For example, fingerspelling F-O-O-D across the forehead to mean “food on the brain” is slightly humorous and more effectively achieves emphasis than signing a statement equivalent to “I can’t stop thinking about food” or “I’m very hungry.”
